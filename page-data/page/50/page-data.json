Security breaches often go undetected for months, giving attackers time to do extensive harm. Once organizations become aware of a breach, they may no longer have access to the logs that comprise a complete history of the attack, because the time span easily exceeds their log retention window.","PublishedAt":"2023-08-03 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/cloud-siem-historical-investigations/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4288,"Title":"DASH 2023: Guide to Datadog's newest announcements","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/dash-2023-new-feature-roundup/dash_2023_roundup_desktop.png\" width=\"100%\"/>This year at DASH, we announced new products and features that enable your teams to get complete visibility into their AI ecosystem, utilize LLM for efficient troubleshooting, take full control of petabytes of observability data, optimize cloud costs, and more.

Not only do teams need to create tests that cover a range of different device types, operating system versions, and user interactions—including swipes, gestures, touches, and more—they also have to maintain the infrastructure and device fleets necessary to run these tests. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive testing strategy that can be implemented by all members of the mobile app team, regardless of technical proficiency.","PublishedAt":"2023-08-03 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/mobile-application-testing/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4290,"Title":"Enhance code reliability with Datadog Quality Gates","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/datadog-quality-gates/quality_gates_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Maintaining the quality of your code becomes increasingly difficult as your organization grows. Engineering teams need to release code quickly while still finding a way to enforce best practices, catch security vulnerabilities, and prevent flaky tests. To address this challenge, Datadog is pleased to introduce Quality Gates, a feature that automatically halts code merges when they fail to satisfy your configured quality checks.Using Quality Gates, your teams can configure rules based on their specific priorities to ensure high standards of code quality, performance, and security.","PublishedAt":"2023-08-03 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-quality-gates/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4291,"Title":"Find vulnerabilities in your code with Datadog Application Vulnerability Management","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/application-code-vulnerability-detection/code-level-vulnerabilities-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>As organizations increasingly adopt continuous delivery practices and deploy code as often as every few seconds, the number of vulnerabilities in your code and the potential for them to go undetected increases. Not knowing which vulnerabilities to focus on can be extremely costly—both in terms of the resources needed to address them as well as the risk they pose for your system. Application security testing tools and approaches can help you search for these vulnerabilities, but they require manual configuration and are slow to adopt and run.","PublishedAt":"2023-08-03 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/application-code-vulnerability-detection/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4292,"Title":"Integration roundup: Monitoring your AI stack","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/ai-integrations/ai_roundup_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Integrating AI, including large language models (LLMs), into your applications enables you to build powerful tools for data analysis, intelligent search, and text and image generation.

Combining complex UI interactions with frequent data fetching, as many Datadog products do, makes optimizing for good runtime performance a challenge. Dashboards in particular is difficult as, unlike other products, users have complete control over the size of their boards and the complexity of their queries.This post describes how we developed a new query and render scheduler, conceived initially to optimize Dashboard performance but then generalized for use on any expensive task or fetch-heavy application.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-17 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/making-fetch-happen-building-a-general-purpose-query-and-render-scheduler/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3421,"Title":"Driving intelligence analysis through a transparent and collaborative approach","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-17 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/intelligence-analysis-transparent-collaborative-approach","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3422,"Title":"Flightwatching helps carriers reduce CO2 emissions and save over $100K per aircraft per year, with Elastic","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-17 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/flightwatching-helps-carriers-with-elastic","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3424,"Title":"Datadog acquires Codiga","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/datadog-acquires-codiga/codiga-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Developers spend over a third of their time fixing bad code and reducing technical debt. Detecting and fixing errors in production is not only more costly than doing so during development but also slows down innovation and has a negative impact on productivity, the development experience, and team morale. Having tools that help catch and fix coding mistakes earlier in the development process creates a better experience and increased productivity. We are pleased to announce that Codiga—which provides powerful static code analysis that works across the development lifecycle—is joining Datadog.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-17 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-acquires-codiga/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3427,"Title":"How to migrate from OpenSearch to Elastic Cloud","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-17 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-migrate-from-opensearch-to-elastic-cloud","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3415,"Title":"3 benefits of migrating and consolidating your source code","Description":"Explore how migrating your source code and collaboration history to GitHub can lead to some surprising benefits.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-14 17:48:51+00:00","OriginURL":"https://github.blog/2023-04-14-3-benefits-of-migrating-and-consolidating-your-source-code/","SourceName":"GitHub"}},{"node":{"ID":3417,"Title":"Using the OAuth 2 token exchange standard for managing the identity platform resources","Description":"<p>This article was written as &quot;Series: The Present and Future of the RFS Project for Strengthening the Technical Infrastructure&quot;.

To ensure that every workload is fully supported, many organizations may opt to over-provision, which leads to overspending. Or, in an attempt to maximize cost savings, organizations may under-provision, leaving workloads unsupported and risking serious performance impacts. By surfacing cloud cost trends alongside performance metrics, usage patterns, and recent deployments, Datadog gives you the context you need to track performance across your cloud infrastructure and streamline your spend.","PublishedAt":"2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/ec2-rightsizing-with-datadog-aws-compute-optimizer/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":2383,"Title":"ERGs encourage you to come as you are: Meet ElastAsians","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-ergs-encourage-you-to-come-as-you-are-meet-elastasians","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2392,"Title":"Announcing TISAX-compliant observability for the automotive industry and its suppliers","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/datadog-tisax-compliance-certification/datadog-tisax-compliance-certification-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Many organizations face complex regulatory requirements when it comes to monitoring the health and performance of their service and application infrastructure.

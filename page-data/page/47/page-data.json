The new package\nrepositories are replacement for the Google-hosted package repositories\n(<code>apt.kubernetes.io</code> and <code>yum.kubernetes.io</code>) that we've been using since\nKubernetes v1.5.</p>\n<p>This blog post contains information about these new package repositories,\nwhat does it mean to you as an end user, and how to migrate to the new\nrepositories.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-package-repositories\">What you need to know about the new package repositories?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This is an <strong>opt-in change</strong>; you're required to manually migrate from the\nGoogle-hosted repository to the Kubernetes community-owned repositories.\nSee <a href=\"#how-to-migrate\">how to migrate</a> later in this announcement for migration information\nand instructions.</li>\n<li>Access to the Google-hosted repository will remain intact for the foreseeable\nfuture. However, the Kubernetes project plans to stop publishing packages to\nthe Google-hosted repository in the future. The project strongly recommends\nmigrating to the Kubernetes package repositories going forward.</li>\n<li>The Kubernetes package repositories contain packages beginning with those\nKubernetes versions that were still under support when the community took\nover the package builds. This means that anything before v1.24.0 will only be\navailable in the Google-hosted repository.</li>\n<li>There's a dedicated package repository for each Kubernetes minor version.\nWhen upgrading to a different minor release, you must bear in mind that\nthe package repository details also change.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"why-are-we-introducing-new-package-repositories\">Why are we introducing new package repositories?</h2>\n<p>As the Kubernetes project is growing, we want to ensure the best possible\nexperience for the end users. The Google-hosted repository has been serving\nus well for many years, but we started facing some problems that require\nsignificant changes to how we publish packages. Another goal that we have is to\nuse community-owned infrastructure for all critical components and that\nincludes package repositories.</p>\n<p>Publishing packages to the Google-hosted repository is a manual process that\ncan be done only by a team of Google employees called\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/release-managers/#build-admins\">Google Build Admins</a>.\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/releases/release-managers/#release-managers\">The Kubernetes Release Managers team</a>\nis a very diverse team especially in terms of timezones that we work in.\nGiven this constraint, we have to do very careful planning for every release to\nensure that we have both Release Manager and Google Build Admin available to\ncarry out the release.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that we only have a single package repository. Because of\nthis, we were not able to publish packages for prerelease versions (alpha,\nbeta, and rc). This made testing Kubernetes prereleases harder for anyone who\nis interested to do so. The feedback that we receive from people testing these\nreleases is critical to ensure the best quality of releases, so we want to make\ntesting these releases as easy as possible. On top of that, having only one\nrepository limited us when it comes to publishing dependencies like <code>cri-tools</code>\nand <code>kubernetes-cni</code>.</p>\n<p>Regardless of all these issues, we're very thankful to Google and Google Build\nAdmins for their involvement, support, and help all these years!</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-the-new-package-repositories-work\">How the new package repositories work?</h2>\n<p>The new package repositories are hosted at <code>pkgs.k8s.io</code> for both Debian and\nRPM packages. At this time, this domain points to a CloudFront CDN backed by S3\nbucket that contains repositories and packages. However, we plan on onboarding\nadditional mirrors in the future, giving possibility for other companies to\nhelp us with serving packages.</p>\n<p>Packages are built and published via the <a href=\"http://openbuildservice.org\">OpenBuildService (OBS) platform</a>.\nAfter a long period of evaluating different solutions, we made a decision to\nuse OpenBuildService as a platform to manage our repositories and packages.\nFirst of all, OpenBuildService is an open source platform used by a large\nnumber of open source projects and companies, like openSUSE, VideoLAN,\nDell, Intel, and more. OpenBuildService has many features making it very\nflexible and easy to integrate with our existing release tooling. It also\nallows us to build packages in a similar way as for the Google-hosted\nrepository making the migration process as seamless as possible.</p>\n<p>SUSE sponsors the Kubernetes project with access to their reference\nOpenBuildService setup (<a href=\"http://build.opensuse.org\"><code>build.opensuse.org</code></a>) and\nwith technical support to integrate OBS with our release processes.</p>\n<p>We use SUSE's OBS instance for building and publishing packages. Upon building\na new release, our tooling automatically pushes needed artifacts and\npackage specifications to <code>build.opensuse.org</code>. That will trigger the build\nprocess that's going to build packages for all supported architectures (AMD64,\nARM64, PPC64LE, S390X). At the end, generated packages will be automatically\npushed to our community-owned S3 bucket making them available to all users.</p>\n<p>We want to take this opportunity to thank SUSE for allowing us to use\n<code>build.opensuse.org</code> and their generous support to make this integration\npossible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-significant-differences-between-the-google-hosted-and-kubernetes-package-repositories\">What are significant differences between the Google-hosted and Kubernetes package repositories?</h2>\n<p>There are three significant differences that you should be aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There's a dedicated package repository for each Kubernetes minor release.\nFor example, repository called <code>core:/stable:/v1.28</code> only hosts packages for\nstable Kubernetes v1.28 releases. This means you can install v1.28.0 from\nthis repository, but you can't install v1.27.0 or any other minor release\nother than v1.28. Upon upgrading to another minor version, you have to add a\nnew repository and optionally remove the old one</li>\n<li>There's a difference in what <code>cri-tools</code> and <code>kubernetes-cni</code> package\nversions are available in each Kubernetes repository\n<ul>\n<li>These two packages are dependencies for <code>kubelet</code> and <code>kubeadm</code></li>\n<li>Kubernetes repositories for v1.24 to v1.27 have same versions of these\npackages as the Google-hosted repository</li>\n<li>Kubernetes repositories for v1.28 and onwards are going to have published\nonly versions that are used by that Kubernetes minor release\n<ul>\n<li>Speaking of v1.28, only kubernetes-cni 1.2.0 and cri-tols v1.28 are going\nto be available in the repository for Kubernetes v1.28</li>\n<li>Similar for v1.29, we only plan on publishing cri-tools v1.29 and\nwhatever kubernetes-cni version is going to be used by Kubernetes v1.29</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The revision part of the package version (the <code>-00</code> part in <code>1.28.0-00</code>) is\nnow autogenerated by the OpenBuildService platform and has a different format.\nThe revision is now in the format of <code>-x.y</code>, e.g. <code>1.28.0-1.1</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"does-this-in-any-way-affect-existing-google-hosted-repositories\">Does this in any way affect existing Google-hosted repositories?</h2>\n<p>The Google-hosted repository and all packages published to it will continue\nworking in the same way as before. There are no changes in how we build and\npublish packages to the Google-hosted repository, all newly-introduced changes\nare only affecting packages publish to the community-owned repositories.</p>\n<p>However, as mentioned at the beginning of this blog post, we plan to stop\npublishing packages to the Google-hosted repository in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-migrate\">How to migrate to the Kubernetes community-owned repositories?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-migrate-deb\">Debian, Ubuntu, and operating systems using <code>apt</code>/<code>apt-get</code></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Replace the <code>apt</code> repository definition so that <code>apt</code> points to the new\nrepository instead of the Google-hosted repository.

Just do the same steps as when migrating, but use parameters\nfor the Google-hosted repository. You can find those parameters in a document\nlike <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm\">&quot;Installing kubeadm&quot;</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-isn-t-there-a-stable-list-of-domains-ips-why-can-t-i-restrict-package-downloads\">Why isn’t there a stable list of domains/IPs? Why can’t I restrict package downloads?</h2>\n<p>Our plan for <code>pkgs.k8s.io</code> is to make it work as a redirector to a set of\nbackends (package mirrors) based on user's location. The nature of this change\nmeans that a user downloading a package could be redirected to any mirror at\nany time. Given the architecture and our plans to onboard additional mirrors in\nthe near future, we can't provide a list of IP addresses or domains that you\ncan add to an allow list.</p>\n<p>Restrictive control mechanisms like man-in-the-middle proxies or network\npolicies that restrict access to a specific list of IPs/domains will break with\nthis change. For these scenarios, we encourage you to mirror the release\npackages to a local package repository that you have strict control over.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-should-i-do-if-i-detect-some-abnormality-with-the-new-repositories\">What should I do if I detect some abnormality with the new repositories?</h2>\n<p>If you encounter any issue with new Kubernetes package repositories, please\nfile an issue in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/release/issues/new/choose\"><code>kubernetes/release</code> repository</a>.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-08-15 20:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/15/pkgs-k8s-io-introduction/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4370,"Title":"Supercharging ML/AI Foundations at Instacart","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-08-15 18:51:20+00:00","OriginURL":"https://tech.instacart.com/supercharging-ml-ai-foundations-at-instacart-d48214a2b511?source=rss----587883b5d2ee---4","SourceName":"Instacart"}},{"node":{"ID":4367,"Title":"Introducing Immortal Objects for Python","Description":"<p>Instagram has introduced Immortal Objects – PEP-683 – to Python.

The people behind this release come from a wide range of backgrounds, some of us industry veterans, parents, others students and newcomers to open-source. We combine our unique experience to create a collective artifact with global impact.</p>\n<p>Much like a garden, our release has ever-changing growth, challenges and opportunities. This theme celebrates the meticulous care, intention and efforts to get the release to where we are today. Harmoniously together, we grow better.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-s-new-major-themes\">What's New (Major Themes)</h1>\n<h2 id=\"changes-to-supported-skew-between-control-plane-and-node-versions\">Changes to supported skew between control plane and node versions</h2>\n<p>This enables testing and expanding the supported skew between core node and control plane components by one version from n-2 to n-3, so that node components (kubelet and kube-proxy) for the oldest supported minor version work with control plane components (kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, cloud-controller-manager) for the newest supported minor version.</p>\n<p>This is valuable for end users as control plane upgrade will be a little faster than node upgrade, which are almost always going to be the longer with running workloads.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes yearly support period already makes annual upgrades possible. Users can upgrade to the latest patch versions to pick up security fixes and do 3 sequential minor version upgrades once a year to &quot;catch up&quot; to the latest supported minor version.</p>\n<p>However, since the tested/supported skew between nodes and control planes is currently limited to 2 versions, a 3-version upgrade would have to update nodes twice to stay within the supported skew.</p>\n<h2 id=\"generally-available-recovery-from-non-graceful-node-shutdown\">Generally available: recovery from non-graceful node shutdown</h2>\n<p>If a node shuts down down unexpectedly or ends up in a non-recoverable state (perhaps due to hardware failure or unresponsive OS), Kubernetes allows you to clean up afterwards and allow stateful workloads to restart on a different node. For Kubernetes v1.28, that's now a stable feature.</p>\n<p>This allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node successfully after the original node is shut down or in a non-recoverable state, such as the hardware failure or broken OS.</p>\n<p>Versions of Kubernetes earlier than v1.20 lacked handling for node shutdown on Linux, the kubelet integrates with systemd\nand implements graceful node shutdown (beta, and enabled by default). However, even an intentional\nshutdown might not get handled well that could be because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the node runs Windows</li>\n<li>the node runs Linux, but uses a different <code>init</code> (not <code>systemd</code>)</li>\n<li>the shutdown does not trigger the system inhibitor locks mechanism</li>\n<li>because of a node-level configuration error\n(such as not setting appropriate values for <code>shutdownGracePeriod</code> and <code>shutdownGracePeriodCriticalPods</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a node shutdowns or fails, and that shutdown was not detected by the kubelet, the pods that are part\nof a StatefulSet will be stuck in terminating status on the shutdown node. If the stopped node restarts, the\nkubelet on that node can clean up (<code>DELETE</code>) the Pods that the Kubernetes API still sees as bound to that node.\nHowever, if the node stays stopped - or if the kubelet isn't able to start after a reboot - then Kubernetes may\nnot be able to create replacement Pods. When the kubelet on the shut-down node is not available to delete\nthe old pods, an associated StatefulSet cannot create a new pod (which would have the same name).</p>\n<p>There's also a problem with storage. If there are volumes used by the pods, existing VolumeAttachments will\nnot be disassociated from the original - and now shut down - node so the PersistentVolumes used by these\npods cannot be attached to a different, healthy node. As a result, an application running on an\naffected StatefulSet may not be able to function properly. If the original, shut down node does come up, then\ntheir pods will be deleted by its kubelet and new pods can be created on a different running node.\nIf the original node does not come up (common with an <a href=\"https://glossary.cncf.io/immutable-infrastructure/\">immutable infrastructure</a> design), those pods would be stuck in a <code>Terminating</code> status on the shut-down node forever.</p>\n<p>For more information on how to trigger cleanup after a non-graceful node shutdown,\nread <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#non-graceful-node-shutdown\">non-graceful node shutdown</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"improvements-to-customresourcedefinition-validation-rules\">Improvements to CustomResourceDefinition validation rules</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cel-go\">Common Expression Language (CEL)</a> can be used to validate\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/\">custom resources</a>. The primary goal is to allow the majority of the validation use cases that might once have needed you, as a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) author, to design and implement a webhook. Instead, and as a beta feature, you can add <em>validation expressions</em> directly into the schema of a CRD.</p>\n<p>CRDs need direct support for non-trivial validation. While admission webhooks do support CRDs validation, they significantly complicate the development and operability of CRDs.</p>\n<p>In 1.28, two optional fields <code>reason</code> and <code>fieldPath</code> were added to allow user to specify the failure reason and fieldPath when validation failed.</p>\n<p>For more information, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#validation-rules\">validation rules</a> in the CRD documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"validatingadmissionpolicies-graduate-to-beta\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies graduate to beta</h2>\n<p>Common Expression language for admission control is customizable, in-process validation of requests to the Kubernetes API server as an alternative to validating admission webhooks.</p>\n<p>This builds on the capabilities of the CRD Validation Rules feature that graduated to beta in 1.25 but with a focus on the policy enforcement capabilities of validating admission control.</p>\n<p>This will lower the infrastructure barrier to enforcing customizable policies as well as providing primitives that help the community establish and adhere to the best practices of both K8s and its extensions.</p>\n<p>To use <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/\">ValidatingAdmissionPolicies</a>, you need to enable both the <code>admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> API group and the <code>ValidatingAdmissionPolicy</code> feature gate in your cluster's control plane.</p>\n<h2 id=\"match-conditions-for-admission-webhooks\">Match conditions for admission webhooks</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.27 lets you specify <em>match conditions</em> for admission webhooks,\nwhich lets you narrow the scope of when Kubernetes makes a remote HTTP call at admission time.\nThe <code>matchCondition</code> field for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and MutatingWebhookConfiguration\nis a CEL expression that must evaluate to true for the admission request to be sent to the webhook.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.28, that field moved to beta, and it's enabled by default.</p>\n<p>To learn more, see <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#matching-requests-matchconditions\"><code>matchConditions</code></a> in the Kubernetes documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beta-support-for-enabling-swap-space-on-linux\">Beta support for enabling swap space on Linux</h2>\n<p>This adds swap support to nodes in a controlled, predictable manner so that Kubernetes users can perform testing and provide data to continue building cluster capabilities on top of swap.</p>\n<p>There are two distinct types of users for swap, who may overlap:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Node administrators, who may want swap available for node-level performance tuning and stability/reducing noisy neighbor issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application developers, who have written applications that would benefit from using swap memory.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mixed-version-proxy\">Mixed version proxy (alpha)</h2>\n<p>When a cluster has multiple API servers at mixed versions (such as during an upgrade/downgrade or when runtime-config changes and a rollout happens), not every apiserver can serve every resource at every version.</p>\n<p>For Kubernetes v1.28, you can enable the <em>mixed version proxy</em> within the API server's aggregation layer.\nThe mixed version proxy finds requests that the local API server doesn't recognize but another API server\ninside the control plan is able to support. Having found a suitable peer, the aggregation layer proxies\nthe request to a compatible API server; this is transparent from the client's perspective.</p>\n<p>When an upgrade or downgrade is performed on a cluster, for some period of time the API servers\nwithin the control plane may be at differing versions; when that happens, different subsets of the\nAPI servers are able to serve different sets of built-in resources (different groups, versions, and resources\nare all possible). This new alpha mechanism lets you hide that skew from clients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"source-code-reorganization-for-control-plane-components\">Source code reorganization for control plane components</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes contributors have begun to reorganize the code for the kube-apiserver to build on a new staging repository that consumes <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/apiserver\">k/apiserver</a> but has a bigger, carefully chosen subset of the functionality of kube-apiserver such that it is reusable.</p>\n<p>This is a gradual reorganization; eventually there will be a new git repository with generic functionality abstracted from Kubernetes' API server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cdi-device-plugin\">Support for CDI injection into containers (alpha)</h2>\n<p>CDI provides a standardized way of injecting complex devices into a container (i.e. devices that logically require more than just a single /dev node to be injected for them to work). This new feature enables plugin developers to utilize the CDIDevices field added to the CRI in 1.27 to pass CDI devices directly to CDI enabled runtimes (of which containerd and crio-o are in recent releases).</p>\n<h2 id=\"sidecar-init-containers\">API awareness of sidecar containers (alpha)</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.28 introduces an alpha <code>restartPolicy</code> field for <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/content/en/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers.md\">init containers</a>,\nand uses that to indicate when an init container is also a <em>sidecar container</em>. The will start init containers with <code>restartPolicy: Always</code> in the order they are defined, along with other init containers. Instead of waiting for that sidecar container to complete before starting the main container(s) for the Pod, the kubelet only waits for\nthe sidecar init container to have started.</p>\n<p>The condition for startup completion will be that the startup probe succeeded (or if no startup probe is defined) and postStart handler is completed. This condition is represented with the field Started of ContainerStatus type. See the section &quot;Pod startup completed condition&quot; for considerations on picking this signal.</p>\n<p>For init containers, you can either omit the <code>restartPolicy</code> field, or set it to <code>Always</code>. Omitting the field\nmeans that you want a true init container that runs to completion before application startup.</p>\n<p>Sidecar containers do not block Pod completion: if all regular containers are complete, sidecar\ncontainers in that Pod will be terminated.</p>\n<p>For sidecar containers, the restart behavior is more complex than for init containers. In a Pod with\n<code>restartPolicy</code> set to <code>Never</code>, a sidecar container that fails during Pod startup will <strong>not</strong> be restarted\nand the whole Pod is treated as having failed. If the Pod's <code>restartPolicy</code> is <code>Always</code> or <code>OnFailure</code>,\na sidecar that fails to start will be retried.</p>\n<p>Once the sidecar container has started (process running, <code>postStart</code> was successful, and\nany configured startup probe is passing), and then there's a failure, that sidecar container will be\nrestarted even when the Pod's overall <code>restartPolicy</code> is <code>Never</code> or <code>OnFailure</code>.\nFurthermore, sidecar containers will be restarted (on failure or on normal exit)\n<em>even during Pod termination</em>.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/#api-for-sidecar-containers\">API for sidecar containers</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"automatic-retroactive-assignment-of-a-default-storageclass-graduates-to-stable\">Automatic, retroactive assignment of a default StorageClass graduates to stable</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes automatically sets a <code>storageClassName</code> for a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) if you don't provide\na value. The control plane also sets a StorageClass for any existing PVC that doesn't have a <code>storageClassName</code>\ndefined.\nPrevious versions of Kubernetes also had this behavior; for Kubernetes v1.28 is is automatic and always\nactive; the feature has graduated to stable (general availability).</p>\n<p>To learn more, read about <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/\">StorageClass</a> in the Kubernetes\ndocumentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pod-replacement-policy\">Pod replacement policy for Jobs (alpha)</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.28 adds a new field for the Job API that allows you to specify if you want the control\nplane to make new Pods as soon as the previous Pods begin termination (existing behavior),\nor only once the existing pods are fully terminated (new, optional behavior).</p>\n<p>Many common machine learning frameworks, such as Tensorflow and JAX, require unique pods per index.\nWith the older behaviour, if a pod that belongs to an <code>Indexed</code> Job enters a terminating state (due to preemption, eviction or other external factors), a replacement pod is created but then immediately fails to start due\nto the clash with the old pod that has not yet shut down.</p>\n<p>Having a replacement Pod appear before the previous one fully terminates can also cause problems\nin clusters with scarce resources or with tight budgets. These resources can be difficult to obtain so pods may only be able to find nodes once the existing pods have been terminated. If cluster autoscaler is enabled, early creation of replacement Pods might produce undesired scale-ups.</p>\n<p>To learn more, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#delayed-creation-of-replacement-pods\">Delayed creation of replacement pods</a>\nin the Job documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"job-per-index-retry-backoff\">Job retry backoff limit, per index (alpha)</h2>\n<p>This extends the Job API to support indexed jobs where the backoff limit is per index, and the Job can continue execution despite some of its indexes failing.</p>\n<p>Currently, the indexes of an indexed job share a single backoff limit. When the job reaches this shared backoff limit, the job controller marks the entire job as failed, and the resources are cleaned up, including indexes that have yet to run to completion.</p>\n<p>As a result, the existing implementation did not cover the situation where the workload is truly\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel\">embarrassingly parallel</a>: each index is\nfully independent of other indexes.</p>\n<p>For instance, if indexed jobs were used as the basis for a suite of long-running integration tests, then each test run would only be able to find a single test failure.</p>\n<p>For more information, read <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#handling-pod-and-container-failures\">Handling Pod and container failures</a> in the Kubernetes documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cri-container-and-pod-statistics-without-cadvisor\">CRI container and pod statistics without cAdvisor</h2>\n<p>This encompasses two related pieces of work (changes to the kubelet's <code>/metrics/cadvisor</code> endpoint and improvements to the replacement <em>summary</em> API).</p>\n<p>There are two main APIs that consumers use to gather stats about running containers and pods: summary API and <code>/metrics/cadvisor</code>. The Kubelet is responsible for implementing the summary API, and cadvisor is responsible for fulfilling <code>/metrics/cadvisor</code>.</p>\n<p>This enhances CRI implementations to be able to fulfill all the stats needs of Kubernetes. At a high level, there are two pieces of this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It enhances the CRI API with enough metrics to supplement the pod and container fields in the summary API directly from CRI.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It enhances the CRI implementations to broadcast the required metrics to fulfill the pod and container fields in the <code>/metrics/cadvisor</code> endpoint.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"feature-graduations-and-deprecations-in-kubernetes-v1-28\">Feature graduations and deprecations in Kubernetes v1.28</h2>\n<h3 id=\"graduations-to-stable\">Graduations to stable</h3>\n<p>This release includes a total of 12 enhancements promoted to Stable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1440\"><code>kubectl events</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3333\">Retroactive default StorageClass assignment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2268\">Non-graceful node shutdown</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/606\">Support 3rd party device monitoring plugins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3325\">Auth API to get self-user attributes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1669\">Proxy Terminating Endpoints</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2595\">Expanded DNS Configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3178\">Cleaning up IPTables Chain Ownership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3453\">Minimizing iptables-restore input size</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3743\">Graduate the kubelet pod resources endpoint to GA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2403\">Extend podresources API to report allocatable resources</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3685\">Move EndpointSlice Reconciler into Staging</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"deprecations-and-removals\">Deprecations and removals</h3>\n<p>Removals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1488\">Removal of CSI Migration for GCE PD</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deprecations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118303\">Ceph RBD in-tree plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118143\">Ceph FS in-tree plugin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"release-notes\">Release Notes</h2>\n<p>The complete details of the Kubernetes v1.28 release are available in our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\">Availability</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.28 is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.28.0\">GitHub</a>.

In this blog post, we'll be shining a spotlight on the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md\">Special Interest Group for Contributor\nExperience</a>\n(SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<p>SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and\nmaintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the\nproject. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may\nhinder the project's growth and feature velocity, such as pull request\nlatency and the number of open pull requests and issues.</p>\n<p>SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by\ncreating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that\nfacilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They\nalso focus on community building and support, including outreach\nprograms and mentorship initiatives to onboard and retain new\ncontributors.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the role of SIG ContribEx is to foster a welcoming and\ninclusive environment that encourages contribution and supports the\nlong-term sustainability of the Kubernetes project.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/1fyka\">Fyka Ansari</a> interviews\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaslinfields\">Kaslin Fields</a>, a DevRel Engineer\nat Google, who is a chair of SIG ContribEx, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MadhavJivrajani\">Madhav\nJivrajani</a>, a Software Engineer\nat VMWare who serves as a SIG ContribEx Tech Lead. This interview\ncovers various aspects of SIG ContribEx, including current\ninitiatives, exciting developments, and how interested individuals can\nget involved and contribute to the group. It provides valuable\ninsights into the workings of SIG ContribEx and highlights the\nimportance of its role in the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introductions\">Introductions</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Let's start by diving into your background and how you got\ninvolved in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Can you tell us more about that\njourney?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> I first got involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem through\nmy mentor, Jonathan Rippy, who introduced me to containers during my\nearly days in tech. Eventually, I transitioned to a team working with\ncontainers, which sparked my interest in Kubernetes when it was\nannounced. While researching Kubernetes in that role, I eagerly sought\nopportunities to engage with the containers/Kubernetes community. It\nwas not until my subsequent job that I found a suitable role to\ncontribute consistently. I joined SIG ContribEx, specifically in the\nContributor Comms subproject, to both deepen my knowledge of\nKubernetes and support the community better.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> My journey with Kubernetes began when I was a student,\nsearching for interesting and exciting projects to work on. With my\npeers, I discovered open source and attended The New Contributor\nWorkshop organized by the Kubernetes community. The workshop not only\nprovided valuable insights into the community structure but also gave\nme a sense of warmth and welcome, which motivated me to join and\nremain involved. I realized that collaboration is at the heart of\nopen-source communities, and to get answers and support, I needed to\ncontribute and do my part. I started working on issues in ContribEx,\nparticularly focusing on GitHub automation, despite not fully\nunderstanding the task at first. I continued to contribute for various\ntechnical and non-technical aspects of the project, finding it to be\none of the most professionally rewarding experiences in my life.</p>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> That's such an inspiration in itself! I'm sure beginners who\nare reading this got the ultimate motivation to take their first\nsteps. Embracing the Learning journey, seeking mentorship, and\nengaging with the Kubernetes community can pave the way for exciting\nopportunities in the tech industry. Your stories proved the importance\nof starting small and being proactive, just like Madhav said Don't be\nafraid to take on tasks, even if you're uncertain at first.</p>\n<h3 id=\"primary-goals-and-scope\">Primary goals and scope</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Given your experience as a member of SIG ContribEx, could\nyou tell us a bit about the group's primary goals and initiatives? Its\ncurrent focus areas? What do you see as the scope of SIG ContribEx and\nthe impact it has on the Kubernetes community?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> SIG ContribEx's primary goals are to simplify the\ncontributions of Kubernetes contributors and foster a welcoming\ncommunity. It collaborates with other Kubernetes SIGs, such as\nplanning the Contributor Summit at KubeCon, ensuring it meets the\nneeds of various groups. The group's impact is evident in projects\nlike updating org membership policies and managing critical platforms\nlike Zoom, YouTube, and Slack. Its scope encompasses making the\ncontributor experience smoother and supporting the overall Kubernetes\ncommunity.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> The Kubernetes project has vertical SIGs and cross-cutting\nSIGs, ContribEx is a deeply cross-cutting SIG, impacting virtually\nevery area of the Kubernetes community. Adding to Kaslin,\nsustainability in the Kubernetes project and community is critical now\nmore than ever, it plays a central role in addressing critical issues,\nsuch as maintainer succession, by facilitating cohorts for SIGs to\ntrain experienced community members to take on leadership\nroles. Excellent examples include SIG CLI and SIG Apps, leading to the\nonboarding of new reviewers. Additionally, SIG ContribEx is essential\nin managing GitHub automation tools, including bots and commands used\nby contributors for interacting with <a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a>\nand other automation (label syncing, group and GitHub team management,\netc).</p>\n<h3 id=\"beginner-s-guide\">Beginner's guide!</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> I'll never forget talking to Kaslin when I joined the\ncommunity and needed help with contributing. Kaslin, your quick and\nclear answers were a huge help in getting me started. Can you both\ngive some tips for people new to contributing to Kubernetes? What\nmakes SIG ContribEx a great starting point? Why should beginners and\ncurrent contributors consider it? And what cool opportunities are\nthere for newbies to jump in?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> If you want to contribute to Kubernetes for the first\ntime, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. A good option is\nto join SIG ContribEx as it offers great opportunities to know and\nserve the community. Within SIG ContribEx, various subprojects allow\nyou to explore different parts of the Kubernetes project while you\nlearn how contributions work. Once you know a bit more, it’s common\nfor you to move to other SIGs within the project, and we think that’s\nwonderful. While many newcomers look for &quot;good first issues&quot; to start\nwith, these opportunities can be scarce and get claimed\nquickly. Instead, the real benefit lies in attending meetings and\ngetting to know the community. As you learn more about the project and\nthe people involved, you'll be better equipped to offer your help, and\nthe community will be more inclined to seek your assistance when\nneeded. As a co-lead for the Contributor Comms subproject, I can\nconfidently say that it's an excellent place for beginners to get\ninvolved. We have supportive leads and particularly beginner-friendly\nprojects too.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> To begin, read the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master#readme\">SIG\nREADME</a> on\nGitHub, which provides an overview of the projects the SIG\nmanages. While attending meetings is beneficial for all SIGs, it's\nespecially recommended for SIG ContribEx, as each subproject gets\ndedicated slots for updates and areas that need help. If you can't\nattend in real-time due to time zone differences, you can catch the\nmeeting recordings or\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K3vjCZ9C3LwYrOJOhztQtFuDQCe-urv-ewx1bI8IPVQ/edit?usp=sharing\">Notes</a>\nlater.</p>\n<h3 id=\"skills-you-learn\">Skills you learn!</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> What skills do you look for when bringing in new\ncontributors to SIG ContribEx, from passion to expertise?\nAdditionally, what skills can contributors expect to develop while\nworking with SIG ContribEx?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> Skills folks need to have or will acquire vary depending\non what area of ContribEx they work upon. Even within a subproject, a\nrange of skills can be useful and/or developed. For example, the tech\nlead role involves technical tasks and overseeing automation, while\nthe social media lead role requires excellent communication\nskills. Working with SIG ContribEx allows contributors to acquire\nvarious skills based on their chosen subproject. By participating in\nmeetings, listening, learning, and taking on tasks related to their\ninterests, they can develop and hone these skills. Some subprojects\nmay require more specialized skills, like program management for the\nmentoring project, but all contributors can benefit from offering\ntheir talents to help teach others and contribute to the community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sub-projects-under-sig-contribex\">Sub-projects under SIG ContribEx</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> SIG ContribEx has several smaller projects. Can you tell me\nabout the aims of these projects and how they've impacted the\nKubernetes community?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> Some SIGs have one or two subprojects and some have none\nat all, but in SIG ContribEx, we have ELEVEN!</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of them and their respective mission statements</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Community</strong>: Manages the community repository, documentation,\nand operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Community management</strong>: Handles communication platforms and\npolicies for the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributor-comms</strong>: Focuses on promoting the success of\nKubernetes contributors through marketing.</li>\n<li><strong>Contributors-documentation</strong>: Writes and maintains documentation\nfor contributing to Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><strong>Devstats</strong>: Maintains and updates the <a href=\"https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io\">Kubernetes\nstatistics</a> website.</li>\n<li><strong>Elections</strong>: Oversees community elections and maintains related\ndocumentation and software.</li>\n<li><strong>Events</strong>: Organizes contributor-focused events like the\nContributor Summit.</li>\n<li><strong>Github management</strong>: Manages permissions, repositories, and\ngroups on GitHub.</li>\n<li><strong>Mentoring</strong>: Develop programs to help contributors progress in\ntheir contributions.</li>\n<li><strong>Sigs-GitHub-actions</strong>: Repository for GitHub actions related to\nall SIGs in Kubernetes.</li>\n<li><strong>Slack-infra</strong>: Creates and maintains tools and automation for\nKubernetes Slack.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> Also, Devstats is critical from a sustainability\nstandpoint!</p>\n<p><em>(If you are willing to learn more and get involved with any of these\nsub-projects, check out the</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md#subprojects\">SIG ContribEx\nREADME</a>)._</p>\n<h3 id=\"accomplishments\">Accomplishments</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> With that said, any SIG-related accomplishment that you’re\nproud of?</p>\n<p><strong>Kaslin:</strong> I'm proud of the accomplishments made by SIG ContribEx and\nits contributors in supporting the community. Some of the recent\nachievements include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Establishment of the elections subproject</em>: Kubernetes is a massive\nproject, and ensuring smooth leadership transitions is\ncrucial. The contributors in this subproject organize fair and\nconsistent elections, which helps keep the project running\neffectively.</li>\n<li><em>New issue triage proces</em>: With such a large open-source project\nlike Kubernetes, there's always a lot of work to be done. To\nensure things progress safely, we implemented new labels and\nupdated functionality for issue triage using our PROW tool. This\nreduces bottlenecks in the workflow and allows leaders to\naccomplish more.</li>\n<li><em>New org membership requirements</em>: Becoming an org member in\nKubernetes can be overwhelming for newcomers. We view org\nmembership as a significant milestone for contributors aiming to\ntake on leadership roles. We recently updated the rules to\nautomatically remove privileges from inactive members, making sure\nthat the right people have access to the necessary tools and\nresponsibilities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, these accomplishments have greatly benefited our fellow\ncontributors and strengthened the Kubernetes community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upcoming-initiatives\">Upcoming initiatives</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Could you give us a sneak peek into what's next for the\ngroup? We're excited to hear about upcoming projects and initiatives\nfrom this dynamic team.</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav:</strong> We’d love for more groups to sign up for mentoring\ncohorts! We’re probably going to have to spend some time polishing the\nprocess around that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> As we wrap up our conversation, would you like to share some\nfinal thoughts for those interested in contributing to SIG ContribEx\nor getting involved with Kubernetes?</p>\n<p><strong>Madhav</strong>: Kubernetes is meant to be overwhelming and difficult\ninitially! You’re coming into something that’s taken multiple people,\nfrom multiple countries, multiple years to build. Embrace that\ndiversity! Use the high entropy initially to collide around and gain\nas much knowledge about the project and community as possible before\nyou decide to settle in your niche.</p>\n<p><strong>Fyka:</strong> Thank You Madhav and Kaslin, it was an absolute pleasure\nchatting about SIG ContribEx and your experiences as a member. It's\nclear that the role of SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is significant and\nessential, ensuring scalability, growth and productivity, and I hope\nthis interview inspires more people to get involved and contribute to\nKubernetes. I wish SIG ContribEx all the best, and can't wait to see\nwhat exciting things lie ahead!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-next\">What next?</h2>\n<p>We love meeting new contributors and helping them in investigating\ndifferent Kubernetes project spaces.

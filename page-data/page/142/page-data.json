This involves managing the finite resources in\nyour nodes, such as CPU, memory, and storage.</p>\n<p><em>cgroups</em> are a Linux kernel capability that establish resource management\nfunctionality like limiting CPU usage or setting memory limits for running\nprocesses.</p>\n<p>When you use the resource management capabilities in Kubernetes, such as configuring\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits\">requests and limits for Pods and containers</a>,\nKubernetes uses cgroups to enforce your resource requests and limits.</p>\n<p>The Linux kernel offers two versions of cgroups: cgroup v1 and cgroup v2.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-cgroup-v2\">What is cgroup v2?</h2>\n<p>cgroup v2 is the latest version of the Linux cgroup API. cgroup v2 provides a\nunified control system with enhanced resource management capabilities.</p>\n<p>cgroup v2 has been development in the Linux Kernel since 2016 and in recent\nyears has matured across the container ecosystem. With Kubernetes 1.25, cgroup\nv2 support has graduated to general availability.</p>\n<p>Many recent releases of Linux distributions have switched over to cgroup v2 by\ndefault so it's important that Kubernetes continues to work well on these new\nupdated distros.</p>\n<p>cgroup v2 offers several improvements over cgroup v1, such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single unified hierarchy design in API</li>\n<li>Safer sub-tree delegation to containers</li>\n<li>Newer features like <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html\">Pressure Stall Information</a></li>\n<li>Enhanced resource allocation management and isolation across multiple resources\n<ul>\n<li>Unified accounting for different types of memory allocations (network and kernel memory, etc)</li>\n<li>Accounting for non-immediate resource changes such as page cache write backs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some Kubernetes features exclusively use cgroup v2 for enhanced resource\nmanagement and isolation. For example,\nthe <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/11/26/qos-memory-resources/\">MemoryQoS feature</a> improves\nmemory utilization and relies on cgroup v2 functionality to enable it. New\nresource management features in the kubelet will also take advantage of the new\ncgroup v2 features moving forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-use-cgroup-v2\">How do you use cgroup v2?</h2>\n<p>Many Linux distributions are switching to cgroup v2 by default; you might start\nusing it the next time you update the Linux version of your control plane and\nnodes!</p>\n<p>Using a Linux distribution that uses cgroup v2 by default is the recommended\nmethod. Some of the popular Linux distributions that use cgroup v2 include the\nfollowing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Container Optimized OS (since M97)</li>\n<li>Ubuntu (since 21.10)</li>\n<li>Debian GNU/Linux (since Debian 11 Bullseye)</li>\n<li>Fedora (since 31)</li>\n<li>Arch Linux (since April 2021)</li>\n<li>RHEL and RHEL-like distributions (since 9)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To check if your distribution uses cgroup v2 by default,\nrefer to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cgroups/#check-cgroup-version\">Check your cgroup version</a> or\nconsult your distribution's documentation.</p>\n<p>If you're using a managed Kubernetes offering, consult your provider to\ndetermine how they're adopting cgroup v2, and whether you need to take action.</p>\n<p>To use cgroup v2 with Kubernetes, you must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Linux distribution enables cgroup v2 on kernel version 5.8 or later</li>\n<li>Your container runtime supports cgroup v2. For example:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://containerd.io/\">containerd</a> v1.4 or later</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cri-o.io/\">cri-o</a> v1.20 or later</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The kubelet and the container runtime are configured to use the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes#systemd-cgroup-driver\">systemd cgroup driver</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The kubelet and container runtime use a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes#cgroup-drivers\">cgroup driver</a>\nto set cgroup paramaters. When using cgroup v2, it's strongly recommended that both\nthe kubelet and your container runtime use the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes#systemd-cgroup-driver\">systemd cgroup driver</a>,\nso that there's a single cgroup manager on the system. To configure the kubelet\nand the container runtime to use the driver, refer to the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes#systemd-cgroup-driver\">systemd cgroup driver documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"migrate-to-cgroup-v2\">Migrate to cgroup v2</h2>\n<p>When you run Kubernetes with a Linux distribution that enables cgroup v2, the\nkubelet should automatically adapt without any additional configuration\nrequired, as long as you meet the requirements.</p>\n<p>In most cases, you won't see a difference in the user experience when you\nswitch to using cgroup v2 unless your users access the cgroup file system\ndirectly.</p>\n<p>If you have applications that access the cgroup file system directly, either on\nthe node or from inside a container, you must update the applications to use\nthe cgroup v2 API instead of the cgroup v1 API.</p>\n<p>Scenarios in which you might need to update to cgroup v2 include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the\nagents to versions that support cgroup v2.</li>\n<li>If you run <a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">cAdvisor</a> as a stand-alone\nDaemonSet for monitoring pods and containers, update it to v0.43.0 or later.</li>\n<li>If you deploy Java applications with the JDK, prefer to use JDK 11.0.16 and\nlater or JDK 15 and later, which <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8230305\">fully support cgroup v2</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more\">Learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cgroups/\">Kubernetes cgroup v2 documentation</a></li>\n<li>Read the enhancement proposal, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2254-cgroup-v2/README.md\">KEP 2254</a></li>\n<li>Learn more about\n<a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html\">cgroups</a> on Linux Manual Pages\nand <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html\">cgroup v2</a> on the Linux Kernel documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"get-involved\">Get involved</h2>\n<p>Your feedback is always welcome! SIG Node meets regularly and are available in\nthe <code>#sig-node</code> channel in the Kubernetes <a href=\"https://slack.k8s.io/\">Slack</a>, or\nusing the SIG <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node#contact\">mailing list</a>.</p>\n<p>cgroup v2 has had a long journey and is a great example of open source\ncommunity collaboration across the industry because it required work across the\nstack, from the Linux Kernel to systemd to various container runtimes, and (of\ncourse) Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>We would like to thank <a href=\"https://github.com/giuseppe\">Giuseppe Scrivano</a> who\ninitiated cgroup v2 support in Kubernetes, and reviews and leadership from the\nSIG Node community including chairs <a href=\"https://github.com/dchen1107\">Dawn Chen</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/derekwaynecarr\">Derek Carr</a>.</p>\n<p>We'd also like to thank the maintainers of container runtimes like Docker,\ncontainerd and CRI-O, and the maintainers of components like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/google/cadvisor\">cAdvisor</a>\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc\">runc, libcontainer</a>,\nwhich underpin many container runtimes.

In static web architecture, pages are generated and pre-rendered at build time from markup files, and usually cached in a content delivery network (CDN) for efficient delivery. This saves teams the effort and cost of server management while enabling fast page load times.With the majority of (if not all) backend logic migrated to the build process and CI/CD, reliance on CDNs for delivering both static assets and page markup, and limited options for instrumenting the frontend to track UX performance, monitoring the health and performance of static web apps presents some challenges.","PublishedAt":"2023-07-12 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/static-web-application-monitoring-best-practices/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4124,"Title":"GitHub CLI project command is now generally available!","Description":"Level up your use of GitHub Projects on the command line and in GitHub Actions with the new project CLI command.","PublishedAt":"2023-07-11 21:52:34+00:00","OriginURL":"https://github.blog/2023-07-11-github-cli-project-command-is-now-generally-available/","SourceName":"GitHub"}},{"node":{"ID":4125,"Title":"Integrating Cloudera Data Warehouse with Kudu Clusters","Description":"<p>Apache Impala and Apache Kudu make a great combination for real-time analytics on streaming data for time series and real-time data warehousing use cases.

They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the\nlogs of the service to debug the issue. The <em>Node log query</em> feature helps with\nthis scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using\n<em>kubectl</em>. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the\nissue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to\nCNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by\nlooking at the Pod status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>The kubelet already has a <em>/var/log/</em> viewer that is accessible via the node\nproxy endpoint. The feature supplements this endpoint with a shim that shells\nout to <code>journalctl</code>, on Linux nodes, and the <code>Get-WinEvent</code> cmdlet on Windows\nnodes. It then uses the existing filters provided by the commands to allow\nfiltering the logs. The kubelet also uses heuristics to retrieve the logs.\nIf the user is not aware if a given system services logs to a file or to the\nnative system logger, the heuristics first checks the native operating system\nlogger and if that is not available it attempts to retrieve the first logs\nfrom <code>/var/log/&lt;servicename&gt;</code> or <code>/var/log/&lt;servicename&gt;.log</code> or\n<code>/var/log/&lt;servicename&gt;/&lt;servicename&gt;.log</code>.</p>\n<p>On Linux we assume that service logs are available via journald, and that\n<code>journalctl</code> is installed. On Windows we assume that service logs are available\nin the application log provider. Also note that fetching node logs is only\navailable if you are authorized to do so (in RBAC, that's <strong>get</strong> and\n<strong>create</strong> access to <code>nodes/proxy</code>). The privileges that you need to fetch node\nlogs also allow elevation-of-privilege attacks, so be careful about how you\nmanage them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>To use the feature, ensure that the <code>NodeLogQuery</code>\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> is\nenabled for that node, and that the kubelet configuration options\n<code>enableSystemLogHandler</code> and <code>enableSystemLogQuery</code> are both set to true. You can\nthen query the logs from all your nodes or just a subset. Here is an example to\nretrieve the kubelet service logs from a node:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#080;font-style:italic\"># Fetch kubelet logs from a node named node-1.example</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubectl get --raw <span style=\"color:#b44\">&#34;/api/v1/nodes/node-1.example/proxy/logs/?query=kubelet&#34;</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can further filter the query to narrow down the results:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#080;font-style:italic\"># Fetch kubelet logs from a node named node-1.example that have the word &#34;error&#34;</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubectl get --raw <span style=\"color:#b44\">&#34;/api/v1/nodes/node-1.example/proxy/logs/?query=kubelet&amp;pattern=error&#34;</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can also fetch files from <code>/var/log/</code> on a Linux node:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubectl get --raw <span style=\"color:#b44\">&#34;/api/v1/nodes/&lt;insert-node-name-here&gt;/proxy/logs/?query=/&lt;insert-log-file-name-here&gt;&#34;</span>\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can read the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#log-query\">documentation</a>\nfor all the available options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-help\">How do I help?</h2>\n<p>Please use the feature and provide feedback by opening GitHub issues or\nreaching out to us on the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0SJ4AFB7\">#sig-windows</a> channel on the\nKubernetes Slack or the SIG Windows\n<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-sig-windows\">mailing list</a>.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-04-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/04/21/node-log-query-alpha/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":3473,"Title":"Enhance SOC workflows with Elastic Security and Recorded Future threat intelligence","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/soc-workflows-elastic-security-recorded-future-threat-intelligence","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3474,"Title":"Elastic joins CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) to defend against US cyber threats","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-joins-jcdc-defend-against-cyber-threats","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3465,"Title":"Amazon S3 Compatible Storage on AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized Devices Now Generally Available","Description":"We have added a collection of purpose-built services to the AWS Snow Family for customers, such as Snowball Edge in 2016 and Snowcone in 2020.

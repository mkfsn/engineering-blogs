If you have an app for beat making, you can let your users post their creations to a dedicated group on SoundCloud. For aspiring music makers, it’s valuable and fun to get feedback from friends on Facebook. And for someone recording an interview with their phone, it’s super handy to be able to post the audio directly to a blog. In addition, a sharing feature is obviously practical for sending files to collaborators or moving audio between devices.","PublishedAt":"2011-04-05 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/sharing-sounds","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":958,"Title":"Hello developers!","Description":"We are happy to introduce you to our new developer portal developers.soundcloud.com.\n  Here we are bundling up all the SoundCloud platform…","PublishedAt":"2011-04-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/developers-soundcloud-com","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":959,"Title":"We ♥ OAuth 2","Description":"From today on, we advise developers to use OAuth 2 as preferred way of API authentication.

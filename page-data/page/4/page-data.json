In this interview, we will talk with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/csantanapr/\">Carlos Santana\n(AWS)</a> to learn a bit more about how he created the\n<a href=\"https://community.cncf.io/kubernetes-virtual-book-club/\">Kubernetes Book Club</a>, how it works, and\nhow anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"csantana_k8s_book_club.jpg\" alt=\"Carlos Santana speaking at KubeCon NA 2023\"></p>\n<p><strong>Frederico Muñoz (FSM)</strong>: Hello Carlos, thank you so much for your availability. To start with,\ncould you tell us a bit about yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Santana (CS)</strong>: Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six\nyears ago opened the door for me to join <a href=\"https://knative.dev/\">Knative</a> and then contribute to\nKubernetes through the Release Team. Working on upstream Kubernetes has been one of the best\nexperiences I've had in open-source. Over the past two years, in my role as a Senior Specialist\nSolutions Architect at AWS, I have been assisting large enterprises build their internal developer\nplatforms (IDP) on top of Kubernetes. Going forward, my open source contributions are directed\ntowards <a href=\"https://cnoe.io/\">CNOE</a> and CNCF projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/argoproj\">Argo</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.crossplane.io/\">Crossplane</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/projects/backstage/\">Backstage</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-the-book-club\">Creating the Book Club</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: So your path led you to Kubernetes, and at that point what was the motivating factor for\nstarting the Book Club?</p>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: The idea for the Kubernetes Book Club sprang from a casual suggestion during a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vmware-archive/tgik\">TGIK</a> livestream. For me, it was more than just about\nreading a book; it was about creating a learning community. This platform has not only been a source\nof knowledge but also a support system, especially during the challenging times of the\npandemic. It's gratifying to see how this initiative has helped members cope and grow. The first\nbook <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/production-kubernetes/9781492092292/\">Production\nKubernetes</a> took 36\nweeks, when we started on March 5th 2021. Currently don't take that long to cover a book, one or two\nchapters per week.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Could you describe the way the Kubernetes Book Club works? How do you select the books and how\ndo you go through them?</p>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: We collectively choose books based on the interests and needs of the group. This practical\napproach helps members, especially beginners, grasp complex concepts more easily. We have two weekly\nseries, one for the EMEA timezone, and I organize the US one. Each organizer works with their co-host\nand picks a book on Slack, then sets up a lineup of hosts for a couple of weeks to discuss each\nchapter.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: If I’m not mistaken, the Kubernetes Book Club is in its 17th book, which is significant: is\nthere any secret recipe for keeping things active?</p>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: The secret to keeping the club active and engaging lies in a couple of key factors.</p>\n<p>Firstly, consistency has been crucial. We strive to maintain a regular schedule, only cancelling\nmeetups for major events like holidays or KubeCon. This regularity helps members stay engaged and\nbuilds a reliable community.</p>\n<p>Secondly, making the sessions interesting and interactive has been vital. For instance, I often\nintroduce pop-up quizzes during the meetups, which not only tests members' understanding but also\nadds an element of fun. This approach keeps the content relatable and helps members understand how\ntheoretical concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.</p>\n<h2 id=\"topics-covered-in-the-book-club\">Topics covered in the Book Club</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: The main topics of the books have been Kubernetes, GitOps, Security, SRE, and\nObservability: is this a reflection of the cloud native landscape, especially in terms of\npopularity?</p>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: Our journey began with 'Production Kubernetes', setting the tone for our focus on practical,\nproduction-ready solutions. Since then, we've delved into various aspects of the CNCF landscape,\naligning our books with a different theme. Each theme, whether it be Security, Observability, or\nService Mesh, is chosen based on its relevance and demand within the community. For instance, in our\nrecent themes on Kubernetes Certifications, we brought the book authors into our fold as active\nhosts, enriching our discussions with their expertise.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: I know that the project had recent changes, namely being integrated into the CNCF as a\n<a href=\"https://community.cncf.io/\">Cloud Native Community Group</a>. Could you talk a bit about this change?</p>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: The CNCF graciously accepted the book club as a Cloud Native Community Group. This is a\nsignificant development that has streamlined our operations and expanded our reach. This alignment\nhas been instrumental in enhancing our administrative capabilities, similar to those used by\nKubernetes Community Days (KCD) meetups. Now, we have a more robust structure for memberships, event\nscheduling, mailing lists, hosting web conferences, and recording sessions.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: How has your involvement with the CNCF impacted the growth and engagement of the Kubernetes\nBook Club over the past six months?</p>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: Since becoming part of the CNCF community six months ago, we've witnessed significant\nquantitative changes within the Kubernetes Book Club. Our membership has surged to over 600 members,\nand we've successfully organized and conducted more than 40 events during this period. What's even\nmore promising is the consistent turnout, with an average of 30 attendees per event. This growth and\nengagement are clear indicators of the positive influence of our CNCF affiliation on the Kubernetes\nBook Club's reach and impact in the community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"joining-the-book-club\">Joining the Book Club</h2>\n<p>FSM: For anyone wanting to join, what should they do?</p>\n<p><strong>CS</strong>: There are three steps to join:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, join the <a href=\"https://community.cncf.io/kubernetes-virtual-book-club/\">Kubernetes Book Club\nCommunity</a></li>\n<li>Then RSVP to the\n<a href=\"https://community.cncf.io/kubernetes-virtual-book-club/\">events</a>\non the community page</li>\n<li>Lastly, join the CNCF Slack channel\n<a href=\"https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C05EYA14P37\">#kubernetes-book-club</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Excellent, thank you!

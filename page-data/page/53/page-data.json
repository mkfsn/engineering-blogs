The command-line\ninterface (CLI) is an integral part of any developer or operatorâ€™s\ntoolkit, offering a convenient and flexible way to interact with a\nKubernetes cluster.</p>\n<p>SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli\">Kubernetes\nCLI</a>\nexperience by focusing on the development and enhancement of\n<code>kubectl</code>, the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>In this SIG CLI Spotlight, Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team\nmember, talked with <a href=\"https://github.com/KnVerey\">Katrina Verey</a>, Tech\nLead &amp; Chair of SIG CLI,and <a href=\"https://github.com/soltysh\">Maciej\nSzulik</a>, SIG CLI Batch Lead, about SIG\nCLI, current projects, challenges and how anyone can get involved.</p>\n<p>So, whether you are a seasoned Kubernetes enthusiast or just getting\nstarted, understanding the significance of SIG CLI will undoubtedly\nenhance your Kubernetes journey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introductions\">Introductions</h2>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how\nyou got involved in SIG CLI?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: Iâ€™m one of the technical leads for SIG-CLI. I was working\non Kubernetes in multiple areas since 2014, and in 2018 I got\nappointed a lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Katrina</strong>: Iâ€™ve been working with Kubernetes as an end-user since\n2016, but it was only in late 2019 that I discovered how well SIG CLI\naligned with my experience from internal projects. I started regularly\nattending meetings and made a few small PRs, and by 2021 I was working\nmore deeply with the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize\">Kustomize</a> team\nspecifically. Later that year, I was appointed to my current roles as\nsubproject owner for Kustomize and KRM Functions, and as SIG CLI Tech\nLead and Chair.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-cli\">About SIG CLI</h2>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: Thank you! Could you share with us the purpose and goals of SIG CLI?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: Our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli/\">charter</a>\nhas the most detailed description, but in few words, we handle all CLI\ntooling that helps you manage your Kubernetes manifests and interact\nwith your Kubernetes clusters.</p>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: I see. And how does SIG CLI work to promote best-practices\nfor CLI development and usage in the cloud native ecosystem?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: Within <code>kubectl</code>, we have several on-going efforts that\ntry to encourage new contributors to align existing commands to new\nstandards. We publish several libraries which hopefully make it easier\nto write CLIs that interact with Kubernetes APIs, such as cli-runtime\nand\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/tree/master/kyaml\">kyaml</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Katrina</strong>: We also maintain some interoperability specifications for\nCLI tooling, such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/cmd/config/docs/api-conventions/functions-spec.md\">KRM Functions\nSpecification</a>\n(GA) and the new ApplySet\nSpecification\n(alpha).</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-projects-and-challenges\">Current projects and challenges</h2>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: Going through the README file, itâ€™s clear SIG CLI has a\nnumber of subprojects, could you highlight some important ones?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: The four most active subprojects that are, in my opinion,\nworthy of your time investment would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl\"><code>kubectl</code></a>: the canonical Kubernetes CLI.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize\">Kustomize</a>: a\ntemplate-free customization tool for Kubernetes yaml manifest files.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kui.tools\">KUI</a> - a GUI interface to Kubernetes, think\n<code>kubectl</code> on steroids.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew\"><code>krew</code></a>: a plugin manager for <code>kubectl</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: Are there any upcoming initiatives or developments that SIG\nCLI is working on?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: There are always several initiatives weâ€™re working on at\nany given point in time. Itâ€™s best to join <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli/#meetings\">one of our\ncalls</a>\nto learn about the current ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Katrina</strong>: For major features, you can check out <a href=\"https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/keps/\">our open\nKEPs</a>. For instance, in\n1.27 we introduced alphas for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/09/introducing-kubectl-applyset-pruning/\">a new pruning mode in kubectl\napply</a>,\nand for kubectl create plugins. Exciting ideas that are currently\nunder discussion include an interactive mode for <code>kubectl</code> delete\n(<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/09/introducing-kubectl-applyset-pruning\">KEP\n3895</a>)\nand the <code>kuberc</code> user preferences file (<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/09/introducing-kubectl-applyset-pruning\">KEP\n3104</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: Could you discuss any challenges that SIG CLI faces in its\nefforts to improve CLIs for cloud-native technologies? What are the\nfuture efforts to solve them?</p>\n<p><strong>Katrina</strong>: The biggest challenge weâ€™re facing with every decision is\nbackwards compatibility and ensuring we donâ€™t break existing users. It\nfrequently happens that fixing what's on the surface may seem\nstraightforward, but even fixing a bug could constitute a breaking\nchange for some users, which means we need to go through an extended\ndeprecation process to change it, or in some cases we canâ€™t change it\nat all. Another challenge is the need to balance customization with\nusability in the flag sets we expose on our tools. For example, we get\nmany proposals for new flags that would certainly be useful to some\nusers, but not a large enough subset to justify the increased\ncomplexity having them in the tool entails for everyone. The <code>kuberc</code>\nproposal may help with some of these problems by giving individual\nusers the ability to set or override default values we canâ€™t change,\nand even create custom subcommands via aliases</p>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: With every new version release of Kubernetes, maintaining\nconsistency and integrity is surely challenging: how does the SIG CLI\nteam tackle it?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: This is mostly similar to the topic mentioned in the\nprevious question: every new change, especially to existing commands\ngoes through a lot of scrutiny to ensure we donâ€™t break existing\nusers. At any point in time we have to keep a reasonable balance\nbetween features and not breaking users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-plans-and-contribution\">Future plans and contribution</h2>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: How do you see the role of CLI tools in the cloud-native\necosystem evolving in the future?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: I think that CLI tools were and will always be an\nimportant piece of the ecosystem. Whether used by administrators on\nremote machines that donâ€™t have GUI or in every CI/CD pipeline, they\nare irreplaceable.</p>\n<p><strong>Arpit</strong>: Kubernetes is a community-driven project. Any\nrecommendation for anyone looking into getting involved in SIG CLI\nwork? Where should they start? Are there any prerequisites?</p>\n<p><strong>Maciej</strong>: There are no prerequisites other than a little bit of free\ntime on your hands and willingness to learn something new :-)</p>\n<p><strong>Katrina</strong>: A working knowledge of <a href=\"https://go.dev/\">Go</a> often helps,\nbut we also have areas in need of non-code contributions, such as the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/4338\">Kustomize docs consolidation\nproject</a>.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-07-20 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/07/20/sig-cli-spotlight-2023/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4186,"Title":"Import Backstage YAML files into Datadog to manage all your services in one place","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/service-catalog-backstage-yaml/backstage-service-catalog_feature-announcement_062123.png\" width=\"100%\"/>The Datadog Service Catalog centralizes your organization&rsquo;s knowledge about the ownership, reliability, performance, costs, and security of your services.

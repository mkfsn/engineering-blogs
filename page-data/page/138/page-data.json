The kubelet, for a worker node,\nwill use the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to accurately surface the initialization\nstate of a pod from the perspective of pod sandbox creation and network\nconfiguration by a container runtime (typically in coordination with CNI\nplugins). The kubelet starts to pull container images and start individual\ncontainers (including init containers) after the status of the <code>PodHasNetwork</code>\ncondition is set to <code>True</code>. Metrics collection services that report latency of\npod initialization from a cluster infrastructural perspective (i.e. agnostic of\nper container characteristics like image size or payload) can utilize the\n<code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to accurately generate Service Level Indicators\n(SLIs). Certain operators or controllers that manage underlying pods may utilize\nthe <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to optimize the set of actions performed when pods\nrepeatedly fail to come up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-this-different-from-the-existing-initialized-condition-reported-for-pods\">How is this different from the existing Initialized condition reported for pods?</h3>\n<p>The kubelet sets the status of the existing <code>Initialized</code> condition reported in\nthe status field of a pod depending on the presence of init containers in a pod.</p>\n<p>If a pod specifies init containers, the status of the <code>Initialized</code> condition in\nthe pod status will not be set to <code>True</code> until all init containers for the pod\nhave succeeded. However, init containers, configured by users, may have errors\n(payload crashing, invalid image, etc) and the number of init containers\nconfigured in a pod may vary across different workloads. Therefore,\ncluster-wide, infrastructural SLIs around pod initialization cannot depend on\nthe <code>Initialized</code> condition of pods.</p>\n<p>If a pod does not specify init containers, the status of the <code>Initialized</code>\ncondition in the pod status is set to <code>True</code> very early in the lifecycle of the\npod. This occurs before the kubelet initiates any pod runtime sandbox creation\nand network configuration steps. As a result, a pod without init containers will\nreport the status of the <code>Initialized</code> condition as <code>True</code> even if the container\nruntime is not able to successfully initialize the pod sandbox environment.</p>\n<p>Relative to either situation above, the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition surfaces more\naccurate data around when the pod runtime sandbox was initialized with\nnetworking configured so that the kubelet can proceed to launch user-configured\ncontainers (including init containers) in the pod.</p>\n<p>Note that a node agent may dynamically re-configure network interface(s) for a\npod by watching changes in pod annotations that specify additional networking\nconfiguration (e.g. <code>k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks</code>). Dynamic updates of pod\nnetworking configuration after the pod sandbox is initialized by Kubelet (in\ncoordination with a container runtime) are not reflected by the <code>PodHasNetwork</code>\ncondition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"try-out-the-podhasnetwork-condition-for-pods\">Try out the PodHasNetwork condition for pods</h3>\n<p>In order to have the kubelet report the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition in the status\nfield of a pod, please enable the <code>PodHasNetworkCondition</code> feature gate on the\nkubelet.</p>\n<p>For a pod whose runtime sandbox has been successfully created and has networking\nconfigured, the kubelet will report the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition with status set to <code>True</code>:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>$ kubectl describe pod nginx1\nName: nginx1\nNamespace: default\n...\nConditions:\nType Status\nPodHasNetwork True\nInitialized True\nReady True\nContainersReady True\nPodScheduled True\n</code></pre><p>For a pod whose runtime sandbox has not been created yet (and networking not\nconfigured either), the kubelet will report the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition with\nstatus set to <code>False</code>:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>$ kubectl describe pod nginx2\nName: nginx2\nNamespace: default\n...\nConditions:\nType Status\nPodHasNetwork False\nInitialized True\nReady False\nContainersReady False\nPodScheduled True\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"what-s-next\">What’s next?</h3>\n<p>Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes team plans to push the\nreporting of the <code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to Beta in 1.26 or 1.27.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-can-i-learn-more\">How can I learn more?</h3>\n<p>Please check out the\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/\">documentation</a> for the\n<code>PodHasNetwork</code> condition to learn more about it and how it fits in relation to\nother pod conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-get-involved\">How to get involved?</h3>\n<p>This feature is driven by the SIG Node community.

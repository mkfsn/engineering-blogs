Speedscale is a testing framework built for Kubernetes applications that enables you to load test with real-world production scenarios by replaying actual API traffic that your application has experienced. Using Speedscale, customers can capture snapshots of real-time traffic and use them to generate sanitized load tests without any scripting required.","PublishedAt":"2022-11-11 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/stress-test-kubernetes-with-speedscale/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":2192,"Title":"Writing a Book?

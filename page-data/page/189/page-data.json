With our existing monitoring set-up, mostly based on\nStatsD and Graphite, we ran into a number of serious limitations. What we\nreally needed was a system with the following features: A multi-dimensional data model, so that data can be sliced and diced\nat will, along dimensions like instance, service, endpoint, and method. Operational simplicity, so that you can spin up a monitoring server\nwhere and when you want, even on your local workstation, without\nsetting up a distributed storage backend or reconfiguring the world. Scalable data collection and decentralized architecture, so that you\ncan reliably monitor the many instances of your services, and\nindependent teams can set up independent monitoring servers. Finally, a powerful query language that leverages the data model for\nmeaningful alerting (including easy silencing) and graphing (for\ndashboards and for ad-hoc exploration). All of these features existed in various systems. However, we could not\nidentify a system that combined them all until a colleague started an ambitious\npet project in 2012 that aimed to do so. Shortly thereafter, we decided to\ndevelop it into SoundCloud’s monitoring system:\nPrometheus was born.","PublishedAt":"2015-01-26 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/prometheus-monitoring-at-soundcloud","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":870,"Title":"SoundCloud in Scalding case study by Concurrent Inc.","Description":"Recently we teamed up with Concurrent Inc., the backers of the data-processing framework Cascading, to do a case study of how we use…","PublishedAt":"2014-12-02 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/soundcloud-concurrent-scalding-case-study","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":871,"Title":"XML responses deprecated","Description":"The SoundCloud API will be dropping support for Extensible Markup Language\n(XML) responses.

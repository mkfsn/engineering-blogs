Translating visibility of individual microservices into broader performance insights often requires drawing complex correlations between spans. This can be a laborious process, which can complicate everything from troubleshooting and triage to tracking KPIs and managing costs.To address these challenges, Trace Queries in Datadog APM allows you to filter and analyze traces based on trace-level attributes (such as the number of spans or end-to-end trace duration), service relationships, endpoints, and other properties.","PublishedAt":"2024-02-12 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/trace-queries/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":5612,"Title":"Elastic APM for iOS and Android Native apps","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2024-02-09 13:58:04+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-apm-for-ios-and-android-native-apps","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":5613,"Title":"Quickly spot and revert faulty deployments with Change Overlays","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/change-overlays/change-overlays-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Faulty deployments and other types of erroneous changes may account for around 70% of all application outages.

As such, Windows Performance Counters can be invaluable for monitoring resource usage and the health of your infrastructure, as well as systems your services are using. For example, a system administrator can monitor performance counters to ensure that infrastructure resources are sufficiently provisioned, stay ahead of bottlenecks in the system, perform root-cause analysis, and troubleshoot issues.","PublishedAt":"2024-02-08 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/windows-performance-counters-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":5604,"Title":"Inferring Creativity","Description":"Nick Hasty, GIPHY&#8217;s VP of Product, Machine Learning was recently interviewed on the ML Ops Community Podcast where he talked about GIPHY&#8217;s history, some AI/ML projects GIPHY has done over the years, and the current AI startup landscape.

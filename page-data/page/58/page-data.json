Events provide key information about the health and status of your clusters—for example, they inform you if container creations are failing, or if pods are being rescheduled again and again. Monitoring these events can help you troubleshoot issues affecting your infrastructure.All components of a cluster create events, so the volume of events generated by your system will grow quickly as you scale your Kubernetes environment.","PublishedAt":"2023-06-28 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-kubernetes-events/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4057,"Title":"Best practices for monitoring CDN logs","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitoring-cdn-logs/cdn_logs_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>By storing copies of your content in geographically distributed servers, content delivery networks (CDNs) enable you to extend the reach of your app without sacrificing performance. CDNs lessen the demand on individual web hosts by increasing the number and regional spread of servers that are able to respond to incoming requests for cached content. As a result, they can deliver web content faster and provide a better experience for your end users.","PublishedAt":"2023-06-28 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-cdn-logs/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4047,"Title":"New AWS AppFabric Improves Application Observability for SaaS Applications","Description":"In today’s business landscape, companies strive to equip their employees with the most suitable and efficient tools to perform their jobs effectively.

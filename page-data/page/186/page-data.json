To recap, adopting a microservices architecture has allowed us to regain team autonomy by breaking up our monolithic backend into dozens of decoupled services, each encapsulating a well defined portion of our product domain. Every service is built and deployed individually, communicating with other services over the network via light-weight data interchange formats such as JSON or Thrift.\nWhat we haven’t touched on so far is how a microservice at SoundCloud looks backstage.","PublishedAt":"2017-07-28 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/inside-a-soundcloud-microservice","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":342,"Title":"Introducing GIPHY Engineering","Description":"Welcome to our new GIPHY Engineering blog!

We had developed a solution to generate right-to-left CSS with Sass mixins and variables as we have [described](https://tech.trivago.com/2015/04/27/right-to-left/) in a blog article. We used this approach for nearly 3 years but recently migrated the right-to-left CSS generation from pre-processing to post-processing with [RTLCSS](http://rtlcss.com/). With this article I would like to share the reasons for the migration as well as our experiences and lessons learned.","PublishedAt":"2017-07-07 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://tech.trivago.com/post/css-done-right-post-rtlcss/","SourceName":"Trivago"}},{"node":{"ID":688,"Title":"Cucable Maven plugin for parallel execution of Cucumber scenarios","Description":"Running Cucumber scenarios in parallel can be tricky, especially when a custom test runner is used.

Entering text requires navigating a virtual keyboard to individual letters, numbers, and characters one at a time – such a nightmare! Plus, letters, numbers, and special characters are spread across three screens. The more secure your password is, the worse the experience is.

At SoundCloud, the proliferation of microservices came from moving functionality out of the mothership. There are plenty of benefits to splitting up features in this way. We want the same benefits for our data as well, by defining ownership of datasets and ensuring that the right teams own the right datasets.","PublishedAt":"2017-06-20 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/a-better-model-of-data-ownership","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":1163,"Title":"畳み込みニューラルネットを高速化するためのいろいろ","Description":"こんにちは、スマートニュースの徳永です。深層学習業界はGANだとか深層強化学習だとかで盛り上がっていますが、今日は淡々と、畳み込みニューラル","PublishedAt":"2017-06-15 02:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developer.smartnews.com/blog/2017/06/convolution-speed-up/","SourceName":"SmartNews"}},{"node":{"ID":343,"Title":"GIPHY Presents: TIME FRAME – Celebrating 30 Years of the GIF","Description":"Happy 30th Birthday to the GIF!

For the first\ntime, several of our most important Gateway API resources are graduating to\nbeta. Additionally, we are starting a new initiative to explore how Gateway API\ncan be used for mesh and introducing new experimental concepts such as URL\nrewrites. We'll cover all of this and more below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-gateway-api\">What is Gateway API?</h2>\n<p>Gateway API is a collection of resources centered around <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/\">Gateway</a> resources\n(which represent the underlying network gateways / proxy servers) to enable\nrobust Kubernetes service networking through expressive, extensible and\nrole-oriented interfaces that are implemented by many vendors and have broad\nindustry support.</p>\n<p>Originally conceived as a successor to the well known <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/ingress-v1/\">Ingress</a> API, the\nbenefits of Gateway API include (but are not limited to) explicit support for\nmany commonly used networking protocols (e.g. <code>HTTP</code>, <code>TLS</code>, <code>TCP</code>, <code>UDP</code>) as\nwell as tightly integrated support for Transport Layer Security (TLS). The\n<code>Gateway</code> resource in particular enables implementations to manage the lifecycle\nof network gateways as a Kubernetes API.</p>\n<p>If you're an end-user interested in some of the benefits of Gateway API we\ninvite you to jump in and find an implementation that suits you. At the time of\nthis release there are over a dozen <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementations</a> for popular API\ngateways and service meshes and guides are available to start exploring quickly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h3>\n<p>Gateway API is an official Kubernetes API like\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">Ingress</a>.\nGateway API represents a superset of Ingress functionality, enabling more\nadvanced concepts. Similar to Ingress, there is no default implementation of\nGateway API built into Kubernetes. Instead, there are many different\n<a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementations</a> available, providing significant choice in terms of underlying\ntechnologies while providing a consistent and portable experience.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/\">API concepts documentation</a> and check out some of\nthe <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/getting-started/\">Guides</a> to start familiarizing yourself with the APIs and how they\nwork. When you're ready for a practical application open the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/\">implementations\npage</a> and select an implementation that belongs to an existing technology\nyou may already be familiar with or the one your cluster provider uses as a\ndefault (if applicable). Gateway API is a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/\">Custom Resource Definition\n(CRD)</a> based API so you'll need to <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/getting-started/#install-the-crds\">install the CRDs</a> onto a\ncluster to use the API.</p>\n<p>If you're specifically interested in helping to contribute to Gateway API, we\nwould love to have you!

One such example is\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-security/1933-secret-logging-static-analysis\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) 1933 Defend Against Logging Secrets via Static Analysis</a> to prevent exposing\nsecrets to logs with <a href=\"@PurelyApplied\">Patrick Rhomberg</a> driving the\nimplementation. As a result of this KEP,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/google/go-flow-levee\"><code>go-flow-levee</code></a>, a taint propagation\nanalysis tool configured to detect logging of secrets, is executed in a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/verify-govet-levee.sh\">script</a>\nas a Prow presubmit job. This KEP was introduced in v1.20.0 as an alpha\nfeature, then graduated to beta in v1.21.0, and graduated to stable in\nv1.23.0. As stable, the analysis runs as a blocking presubmit test. This\nKEP also helped resolve the following issues from the 2019 third party security audit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81114\">#81114 Bearer tokens are revealed in logs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81117\">#81117 Environment variables expose sensitive data</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81130\">#81130 iSCSI volume storage cleartext secrets in logs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"remaining-work\">Remaining Work</h2>\n<p>Many of the 37 findings identified were fixed by work from\nour community members over the last 3 years. However, we still have some work\nleft to do. Here's a breakdown of remaining work with rough estimates on\ntime commitment, complexity and benefits to the ecosystem on fixing\nthese pending issues.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info note callout\" role=\"alert\">\n<strong>Note:</strong> Anything requiring a KEP (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal) is considered\n<em>high</em> time commitment and <em>high</em> complexity.

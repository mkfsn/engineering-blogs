How does this whole process of integration\nof Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let's put the spotlight on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cloud-provider/README.md\">SIG\nCloud Provider</a>.</p>\n<p>SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud\nproviders. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear\nstandards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is\ntheir responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations.</p>\n<p>In this blog of the SIG Spotlight series, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arujjval\">Arujjwal Negi</a> interviews\n<a href=\"https://github.com/elmiko\">Michael McCune</a> (Red Hat), also known as <em>elmiko</em>, co-chair of SIG Cloud\nProvider, to give us an insight into the workings of this group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal</strong>: Let's start by getting to know you. Can you give us a small intro about yourself and\nhow you got into Kubernetes?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Hi, I’m Michael McCune, most people around the community call me by my handle,\n<em>elmiko</em>. I’ve been a software developer for a long time now (Windows 3.1 was popular when I\nstarted!), and I’ve been involved with open-source software for most of my career. I first got\ninvolved with Kubernetes as a developer of machine learning and data science applications; the team\nI was on at the time was creating tutorials and examples to demonstrate the use of technologies like\nApache Spark on Kubernetes. That said, I’ve been interested in distributed systems for many years\nand when an opportunity arose to join a team working directly on Kubernetes, I jumped at it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"functioning-and-working\">Functioning and working</h2>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal</strong>: Can you give us an insight into what SIG Cloud Provider does and how it functions?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael</strong>: SIG Cloud Provider was formed to help ensure that Kubernetes provides a neutral\nintegration point for all infrastructure providers. Our largest task to date has been the extraction\nand migration of in-tree cloud controllers to out-of-tree components. The SIG meets regularly to\ndiscuss progress and upcoming tasks and also to answer questions and bugs that\narise. Additionally, we act as a coordination point for cloud provider subprojects such as the cloud\nprovider framework, specific cloud controller implementations, and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-konnectivity/\">Konnectivity proxy\nproject</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal:</strong> After going through the project\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cloud-provider/README.md\">README</a>, I\nlearned that SIG Cloud Provider works with the integration of Kubernetes with cloud providers. How\ndoes this whole process go?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> One of the most common ways to run Kubernetes is by deploying it to a cloud environment\n(AWS, Azure, GCP, etc). Frequently, the cloud infrastructures have features that enhance the\nperformance of Kubernetes, for example, by providing elastic load balancing for Service objects. To\nensure that cloud-specific services can be consistently consumed by Kubernetes, the Kubernetes\ncommunity has created cloud controllers to address these integration points. Cloud providers can\ncreate their own controllers either by using the framework maintained by the SIG or by following\nthe API guides defined in the Kubernetes code and documentation. One thing I would like to point out\nis that SIG Cloud Provider does not deal with the lifecycle of nodes in a Kubernetes cluster;\nfor those types of topics, SIG Cluster Lifecycle and the Cluster API project are more appropriate\nvenues.</p>\n<h2 id=\"important-subprojects\">Important subprojects</h2>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal:</strong> There are a lot of subprojects within this SIG. Can you highlight some of the most\nimportant ones and what job they do?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> I think the two most important subprojects today are the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cloud-provider/README.md#kubernetes-cloud-provider\">cloud provider\nframework</a>\nand the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cloud-provider/README.md#cloud-provider-extraction-migration\">extraction/migration\nproject</a>. The\ncloud provider framework is a common library to help infrastructure integrators build a cloud\ncontroller for their infrastructure. This project is most frequently the starting point for new\npeople coming to the SIG. The extraction and migration project is the other big subproject and a\nlarge part of why the framework exists. A little history might help explain further: for a long\ntime, Kubernetes needed some integration with the underlying infrastructure, not\nnecessarily to add features but to be aware of cloud events like instance termination. The cloud\nprovider integrations were built into the Kubernetes code tree, and thus the term &quot;in-tree&quot; was\ncreated (check out this <a href=\"https://kaslin.rocks/out-of-tree/\">article on the topic</a> for more\ninfo). The activity of maintaining provider-specific code in the main Kubernetes source tree was\nconsidered undesirable by the community. The community’s decision inspired the creation of the\nextraction and migration project to remove the &quot;in-tree&quot; cloud controllers in favor of\n&quot;out-of-tree&quot; components.</p>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal:</strong> What makes [the cloud provider framework] a good place to start? Does it have consistent good beginner work? What\nkind?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> I feel that the cloud provider framework is a good place to start as it encodes the\ncommunity’s preferred practices for cloud controller managers and, as such, will give a newcomer a\nstrong understanding of how and what the managers do. Unfortunately, there is not a consistent\nstream of beginner work on this component; this is due in part to the mature nature of the framework\nand that of the individual providers as well. For folks who are interested in getting more involved,\nhaving some <a href=\"https://go.dev/\">Go language</a> knowledge is good and also having an understanding of\nhow at least one cloud API (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) works is also beneficial. In my personal opinion,\nbeing a newcomer to SIG Cloud Provider can be challenging as most of the code around this project\ndeals directly with specific cloud provider interactions. My best advice to people wanting to do\nmore work on cloud providers is to grow your familiarity with one or two cloud APIs, then look\nfor open issues on the controller managers for those clouds, and always communicate with the other\ncontributors as much as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accomplishments\">Accomplishments</h2>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal:</strong> Can you share about an accomplishment(s) of the SIG that you are proud of?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Since I joined the SIG, more than a year ago, we have made great progress in advancing\nthe extraction and migration subproject. We have moved from an alpha status on the defining\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md\">KEP</a> to a beta status and\nare inching ever closer to removing the old provider code from the Kubernetes source tree. I've been\nreally proud to see the active engagement from our community members and to see the progress we have\nmade towards extraction. I have a feeling that, within the next few releases, we will see the final\nremoval of the in-tree cloud controllers and the completion of the subproject.</p>\n<h2 id=\"advice-for-new-contributors\">Advice for new contributors</h2>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal:</strong> Is there any suggestion or advice for new contributors on how they can start at SIG\nCloud Provider?</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> This is a tricky question in my opinion. SIG Cloud Provider is focused on the code\npieces that integrate between Kubernetes and an underlying infrastructure. It is very common, but\nnot necessary, for members of the SIG to be representing a cloud provider in an official capacity. I\nrecommend that anyone interested in this part of Kubernetes should come to an SIG meeting to see how\nwe operate and also to study the cloud provider framework project. We have some interesting ideas\nfor future work, such as a common testing framework, that will cut across all cloud providers and\nwill be a great opportunity for anyone looking to expand their Kubernetes involvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Arujjwal:</strong> Are there any specific skills you're looking for that we should highlight? To give you\nan example from our own [SIG ContribEx]\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md)\">https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md)</a>:\nif you're an expert in <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a>, we can always use some help with k8s.dev!</p>\n<p><strong>Michael:</strong> The SIG is currently working through the final phases of our extraction and migration\nprocess, but we are looking toward the future and starting to plan what will come next. One of the\nbig topics that the SIG has discussed is testing. Currently, we do not have a generic common set of\ntests that can be exercised by each cloud provider to confirm the behaviour of their controller\nmanager. If you are an expert in Ginkgo and the Kubetest framework, we could probably use your help\nin designing and implementing the new tests.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is where the conversation ends. I hope this gave you some insights about SIG Cloud Provider's\naim and working. This is just the tip of the iceberg.

This level of scale makes it more challenging for engineers to identify system failures before they lead to costly outages. System failures are often difficult to predict in cloud environments, and security threats add another layer of complexity. As a solution, engineers are turning to approaches like chaos engineering (CE) to proactively find potential points of failure within their cloud infrastructure.","PublishedAt":"2023-10-10 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/chaos-engineering-for-security/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4776,"Title":"Elastic Stack 7.17.14 released","Description":"<p>Version 7.17.14 of the Elastic Stack was released today.

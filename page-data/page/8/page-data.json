The base path for the kubelet and local\nKubernetes-specific storage is configurable, but it is usually assumed to be <code>/var/lib/kubelet</code>.\nIn the Kubernetes docs, this is sometimes referred to as the root or node filesystem. The bulk of this data can be categorized into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ephemeral storage</li>\n<li>logs</li>\n<li>and container runtime</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is different from most POSIX systems as the root/node filesystem is not <code>/</code> but the disk that <code>/var/lib/kubelet</code> is on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ephemeral-storage\">Ephemeral storage</h3>\n<p>Pods and containers can require temporary or transient local storage for their operation.\nThe lifetime of the ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod, and the ephemeral storage cannot be shared across pods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"logs\">Logs</h3>\n<p>By default, Kubernetes stores the logs of each running container, as files within <code>/var/log</code>.\nThese logs are ephemeral and are monitored by the kubelet to make sure that they do not grow too large while the pods are running.</p>\n<p>You can customize the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#log-rotation\">log rotation</a> settings\nfor each node to manage the size of these logs, and configure log shipping (using a 3rd party solution)\nto avoid relying on the node-local storage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"container-runtime\">Container runtime</h3>\n<p>The container runtime has two different areas of storage for containers and images.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>read-only layer: Images are usually denoted as the read-only layer, as they are not modified when containers are running.\nThe read-only layer can consist of multiple layers that are combined into a single read-only layer.\nThere is a thin layer on top of containers that provides ephemeral storage for containers if the container is writing to the filesystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>writeable layer: Depending on your container runtime, local writes might be\nimplemented as a layered write mechanism (for example, <code>overlayfs</code> on Linux or CimFS on Windows).\nThis is referred to as the writable layer.\nLocal writes could also use a writeable filesystem that is initialized with a full clone of the container\nimage; this is used for some runtimes based on hypervisor virtualisation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The container runtime filesystem contains both the read-only layer and the writeable layer.\nThis is considered the <code>imagefs</code> in Kubernetes documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"container-runtime-configurations\">Container runtime configurations</h2>\n<h3 id=\"cri-o\">CRI-O</h3>\n<p>CRI-O uses a storage configuration file in TOML format that lets you control how the container runtime stores persistent and temporary data.\nCRI-O utilizes the <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/storage\">storage library</a>.<br>\nSome Linux distributions have a manual entry for storage (<code>man 5 containers-storage.conf</code>).\nThe main configuration for storage is located in <code>/etc/containers/storage.conf</code> and one can control the location for temporary data and the root directory.<br>\nThe root directory is where CRI-O stores the persistent data.</p>\n<div

id=\"kubernetes-node-pressure-eviction\">Kubernetes node pressure eviction</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes will automatically detect if the container filesystem is split from the node filesystem.\nWhen one separates the filesystem, Kubernetes is responsible for monitoring both the node filesystem and the container runtime filesystem.\nKubernetes documentation refers to the node filesystem and the container runtime filesystem as nodefs and imagefs.\nIf either nodefs or the imagefs are running out of disk space, then the overall node is considered to have disk pressure.\nKubernetes will first reclaim space by deleting unusued containers and images, and then it will resort to evicting pods.\nOn a node that has a nodefs and an imagefs, the kubelet will\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#containers-images\">garbage collect</a> unused container images\non imagefs and will remove dead pods and their containers from the nodefs.\nIf there is only a nodefs, then Kubernetes garbage collection includes dead containers, dead pods and unused images.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes allows more configurations for determining if your disk is full.<br>\nThe eviction manager within the kubelet has some configuration settings that let you control\nthe relevant thresholds.\nFor filesystems, the relevant measurements are <code>nodefs.available</code>, <code>nodefs.inodesfree</code>, <code>imagefs.available</code>, and <code>imagefs.inodesfree</code>.\nIf there is not a dedicated disk for the container runtime then imagefs is ignored.</p>\n<p>Users can use the existing defaults:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>memory.available</code> &lt; 100MiB</li>\n<li><code>nodefs.available</code> &lt; 10%</li>\n<li><code>imagefs.available</code> &lt; 15%</li>\n<li><code>nodefs.inodesFree</code> &lt; 5% (Linux nodes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kubernetes allows you to set user defined values in <code>EvictionHard</code> and <code>EvictionSoft</code> in the kubelet configuration file.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>EvictionHard</code></dt>\n<dd>defines limits; once these limits are exceeded, pods will be evicted without any grace period.</dd>\n<dt><code>EvictionSoft</code></dt>\n<dd>defines limits; once these limits are exceeded, pods will be evicted with a grace period that can be set per signal.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>If you specify a value for <code>EvictionHard</code>, it will replace the defaults.<br>\nThis means it is important to set all signals in your configuration.</p>\n<p>For example, the following kubelet configuration could be used to configure <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/node-pressure-eviction/#eviction-signals-and-thresholds\">eviction signals</a> and grace period options.</p>\n<div

id=\"problems\">Problems</h3>\n<p>The Kubernetes project recommends that you either use the default settings for eviction or you set all the fields for eviction.\nYou can use the default settings or specify your own <code>evictionHard</code> settings. If you miss a signal, then Kubernetes will not monitor that resource.\nOne common misconfiguration administrators or users can hit is mounting a new filesystem to <code>/var/lib/containers/storage</code> or <code>/var/lib/containerd</code>.\nKubernetes will detect a separate filesystem, so you want to make sure to check that <code>imagefs.inodesfree</code> and <code>imagefs.available</code> match your needs if you've done this.</p>\n<p>Another area of confusion is that ephemeral storage reporting does not change if you define an image\nfilesystem for your node. The image filesystem (<code>imagefs</code>) is used to store container image layers; if a\ncontainer writes to its own root filesystem, that local write doesn't count towards the size of the container image. The place where the container runtime stores those local modifications is runtime-defined, but is often\nthe image filesystem.\nIf a container in a pod is writing to a filesystem-backed <code>emptyDir</code> volume, then this uses space from the\n<code>nodefs</code> filesystem.\nThe kubelet always reports ephemeral storage capacity and allocations based on the filesystem represented\nby <code>nodefs</code>; this can be confusing when ephemeral writes are actually going to the image filesystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-work\">Future work</h3>\n<p>To fix the ephemeral storage reporting limitations and provide more configuration options to the container runtime, SIG Node are working on <a href=\"http://kep.k8s.io/4191\">KEP-4191</a>.\nIn KEP-4191, Kubernetes will detect if the writeable layer is separated from the read-only layer (images).\nThis would allow us to have all ephemeral storage, including the writeable layer, on the same disk as well as allowing for a separate disk for images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h3>\n<p>If you would like to get involved, you can\njoin <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node\">Kubernetes Node Special-Interest-Group</a> (SIG).</p>\n<p>If you would like to share feedback, you can do so on our\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C0BP8PW9G\">#sig-node</a> Slack channel.\nIf you're not already part of that Slack workspace, you can visit <a href=\"https://slack.k8s.io/\">https://slack.k8s.io/</a> for an invitation.</p>\n<p>Special thanks to all the contributors who provided great reviews, shared valuable insights or suggested the topic idea.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peter Hunt</li>\n<li>Mrunal Patel</li>\n<li>Ryan Phillips</li>\n<li>Gaurav Singh</li>\n</ul>","PublishedAt":"2024-01-23 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/01/23/kubernetes-separate-image-filesystem/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":5548,"Title":"How to get in the flow while coding (and why it’s important)","Description":"<p>Explore what flow state entails, its benefits, and three tips for reaching it the next time you code.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://github.blog/2024-01-22-how-to-get-in-the-flow-while-coding-and-why-its-important/\">How to get in the flow while coding (and why it’s important)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://github.blog\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\n","PublishedAt":"2024-01-22 19:46:30+00:00","OriginURL":"https://github.blog/2024-01-22-how-to-get-in-the-flow-while-coding-and-why-its-important/","SourceName":"GitHub"}},{"node":{"ID":5546,"Title":"AWS Weekly Roundup — Amazon ECS, RDS for MySQL, EMR Studio, AWS Community, and more — January 22, 2024","Description":"As usual, a lot has happened in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) universe this past week.

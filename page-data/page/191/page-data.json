They’ve built some amazing\ncommunity features into their app\nTabletop\nusing the SoundCloud API and have open sourced their CloudSeeder\nDevkit.  This post was written for us by David Shu. David is a\nsoftware engineer at the Retronyms and has worked on a number of iOS\napps, including Tabletop and Dokobots. He currently resides in San\nFrancisco, CA. We recently built a SoundCloud-powered community into our app\nTabletop,\na modular audio environment for the iPad, using the\nCocoaSoundCloudAPI.\nThe project, CloudSeeder, lets users browse, stream, favorite, and\ncomment on Tabletop tracks without ever leaving the app. As developers, we discovered tons of talented users in our Tabletop\ncommunity. At the same time, our users found inspiration from each\nother and a new showcase for their creations. To share in the\nexcitement of community creation with all developers, today we’re\nreleasing the CloudSeeder Devkit as open source on\nGoogle Code.","PublishedAt":"2012-08-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/introducing-the-cloudseeder-devkit","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":903,"Title":"Go at SoundCloud","Description":"SoundCloud is a polyglot company, and while we’ve always operated with Ruby on Rails at the top of our stack, we’ve got quite a wide variety…","PublishedAt":"2012-07-24 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/go-at-soundcloud","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":904,"Title":"Recording and Sharing Phone Calls","Description":"A few weeks ago, I attended News Hack Day in San Francisco.\nNews Hack Days are events that bring together journalists, developers and designers for multi\nday creative coding and brainstorming sessions. I really like the idea of hack days that bring together people from different backgrounds. After\nchatting with a few journalists, it became obvious to me that recording interviews on the phone\nis a real pain. I saw this as an opportunity to build a fun app that would make this easier for\npeople.","PublishedAt":"2012-07-12 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/recording-and-sharing-phone-calls","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":905,"Title":"SocialFolders Releases SoundCloud Ruby Gem","Description":"There are many approaches to building libraries that wrap HTTP APIs. For many of our\nofficially supported SDKs we\nchose to build light wrappers around HTTP client libraries with a few added features\nto make it easier to work with the SoundCloud API. This approach has a few benefits.\nIt guarantees a certain consistency and is relatively easy to maintain. It’s also fairly\nfuture proof. Changes in the HTTP API do not typically require updates to client libraries. Sometimes however, you might be looking for something a bit more feature-full, or with\nmore abstraction from our HTTP API. That’s why I was really happy to see that the great folks at\nSocialFolders built an alternative SoundCloud Ruby gem and\nreleased it to the public. You can check out their blog post\nabout it or go straight to the source on GitHub.","PublishedAt":"2012-07-06 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/socialfolders-releases-soundcloud-gem","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":906,"Title":"Music Hack Day Barcelona 2012","Description":"SoundCloud loves hack days.

SoundCloud joined several other API providers, including Atomic Reach, Context.IO, FreshBooks, Shopify, TinEye, Twilio, Trendspottr, WordPress and YellowAPI. The idea behind the event is simple: find a team (or go solo) and build an app using one or more of the APIs presented by sponsors. All apps have to be demoable by 5pm at which time you pitch to the judges who select the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners.","PublishedAt":"2012-04-17 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/soundcloud-at-hackto","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":911,"Title":"Create rich media experiences using timed comments","Description":"In the last weeks we got pretty excited about the idea of using timed comments to create and script rich media experiences.

When the need arises, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-wg-lifecycle.md\">new SIGs can be created</a>, and that was precisely what happened recently.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md\">SIG etcd</a> is the most recent addition to the list of Kubernetes SIGs. In this article we will get to know it a bit better, understand its origins, scope, and plans.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-critical-role-of-etcd\">The critical role of etcd</h2>\n<p>If we look inside the control plane of a Kubernetes cluster, we will find <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd\">etcd</a>, a consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data -- this description alone highlights the critical role that etcd plays, and the importance of it within the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This critical role makes the health of the etcd project and community an important consideration, and <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/steering/c/e-O-tVSCJOk/m/N9IkiWLEAgAJ\">concerns about the state of the project</a> in early 2022 did not go unnoticed. The changes in the maintainer team, amongst other factors, contributed to a situation that needed to be addressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-a-special-interest-group\">Why a special interest group</h2>\n<p>With the critical role of etcd in mind, it was proposed that the way forward would be to create a new special interest group. If etcd was already at the heart of Kubernetes, creating a dedicated SIG not only recognises that role, it would make etcd a first-class citizen of the Kubernetes community.</p>\n<p>Establishing SIG etcd creates a dedicated space to make explicit the contract between etcd and Kubernetes api machinery and to prevent, on the etcd level, changes which violate this contract. Additionally, etcd will be able to adopt the processes that Kubernetes offers its SIGs (<a href=\"https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/keps/\">KEPs</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">PRR</a>, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">phased feature gates</a>, amongst others) in order to improve the consistency and reliability of the codebase. Being able to use these processes will be a substantial benefit to the etcd community.</p>\n<p>As a SIG, etcd will also be able to draw contributor support from Kubernetes proper: active contributions to etcd from Kubernetes maintainers would decrease the likelihood of breaking Kubernetes changes, through the increased number of potential reviewers and the integration with existing testing framework. This will not only benefit Kubernetes, which will be able to better participate and shape the direction of etcd in terms of the critical role it plays, but also etcd as a whole.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-etcd\">About SIG etcd</h2>\n<p>The recently created SIG is already working towards its goals, defined in its <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/charter.md\">Charter</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/vision.md\">Vision</a>. The purpose is clear: to ensure etcd is a reliable, simple, and scalable production-ready store for building cloud-native distributed systems and managing cloud-native infrastructure via orchestrators like Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>The scope of SIG etcd is not exclusively about etcd as a Kubernetes component, it also covers etcd as a standard solution. Our goal is to make etcd the most reliable key-value storage to be used anywhere, unconstrained by any Kubernetes-specific limits and scaling to meet the requirements of many diverse use-cases.</p>\n<p>We are confident that the creation of SIG etcd constitutes an important milestone in the lifecycle of the project, simultaneously improving etcd itself, and also the integration of etcd with Kubernetes. We invite everyone interested in etcd to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md\">visit our page</a>, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/etcd\">join us at our Slack channel</a>, and get involved in this new stage of etcd's life.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-11-07 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/11/07/introducing-sig-etcd/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4960,"Title":"AWS Weekly Roundup—Reserve GPU capacity for short ML workloads, Finch is GA, and more—November 6, 2023","Description":"The year is coming to an end, and there are only 50 days until Christmas and 21 days to AWS re:Invent!

To find out why, and to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, we interview\nNoah Abrahams, whom amongst other roles was the co-lead for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in\n2023.</p>\n<p><strong>Frederico Muñoz (FSM)</strong>: Hello Noah, and welcome. Could you start by introducing yourself and\ntelling us how you got involved in Kubernetes?</p>\n<p><strong>Noah Abrahams (NA)</strong>: I’ve been in this space for quite a while.  I got started in IT in the mid\n90's, and I’ve been working in the &quot;Cloud&quot; space for about 15 years.  It was, frankly, through a\ncombination of sheer luck (being in the right place at the right time) and having good mentors to\npull me into those places (thanks, Tim!), that I ended up at a startup called Apprenda in 2016.\nWhile I was there, they pivoted into Kubernetes, and it was the best thing that could have happened\nto my career.  It was around v1.2 and someone asked me if I could give a presentation on Kubernetes\nconcepts at &quot;my local meetup&quot; in Las Vegas.  The meetup didn’t exist yet, so I created it, and got\ninvolved in the wider community.  One thing led to another, and soon I was involved in ContribEx,\njoined the release team, was doing booth duty for the CNCF, became an ambassador, and here we are\ntoday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-contributor-summit\">The Contributor Summit</h2>\n<p><img src=\"kcseu2023-group.jpg\" alt=\"KCSEU 2023 group photo\"></p>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: Before leading the organisation of the KCSEU 2023, how many other Contributor Summits were\nyou a part of?</p>\n<p><strong>NA</strong>: I was involved in four or five before taking the lead. If I'm recalling correctly, I\nattended the summit in Copenhagen, then sometime in 2018 I joined the wrong meeting, because the\nsummit staff meeting was listed on the ContribEx calendar. Instead of dropping out of the call, I\nlistened a bit, then volunteered to take on some work that didn't look like it had anybody yet\ndedicated to it. I ended up running Ops in Seattle and helping run the New Contributor Workshop in\nShanghai, that year. Since then, I’ve been involved in all but two, since I missed both Barcelona\nand Valencia.</p>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: Have you noticed any major changes in terms of how the conference is organized throughout\nthe years? Namely in terms of number of participants, venues, speakers, themes...</p>\n<p><strong>NA</strong>: The summit changes over the years with the ebb and flow of the desires of the contributors\nthat attend. While we can typically expect about the same number of attendees, depending on the\nregion that the event is held in, we adapt the style and content greatly based on the feedback that\nwe receive at the end of each event. Some years, contributors ask for more free-style or\nunconference type sessions, and we plan on having more of those, but some years, people ask for more\nplanned sessions or workshops, so that's what we facilitate. We also have to continually adapt to\nthe venue that we have, the number of rooms we're allotted, how we're going to share the space with\nother events and so forth. That all goes into the planning ahead of time, from how many talk tracks\nwe’ll have, to what types of tables and how many microphones we want in a room.</p>\n<p>There has been one very significant change over the years, though, and that is that we no longer run\nthe New Contributor Workshop. While the content was valuable, running the session during the summit\nnever led to any people who weren’t already contributing to the project becoming dedicated\ncontributors to the project, so we removed it from the schedule. We'll deliver that content another\nway, while we’ll keep the summit focused on existing contributors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-makes-it-special\">What makes it special</h2>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: Going back to the introduction I made, I’ve heard several participants saying that KubeCon\nis great, but that the Contributor Summit is for them the main event. In your opinion, why do you\nthink that makes it so?</p>\n<p><strong>NA</strong>: I think part of it ties into what I mentioned a moment ago, the flexibility in our content\ntypes. For many contributors, I think the summit is basically &quot;How Kubecon used to be&quot;, back when\nit was primarily a gathering of the contributors to talk about the health of the project and the\nwork that needed to be done. So, in that context, if the contributors want to discuss, say, a new\nWorking Group, then they have dedicated space to do so in the summit. They also have the space to\nsit down and hack on a tough problem, discuss architectural philosophy, bring potential problems to\nmore people’s attention, refine our methods, and so forth. Plus, the unconference aspect allows for\nsome malleability on the day-of, for whatever is most important right then and there. Whatever\nfolks want to get out of this environment is what we’ll provide, and having a space and time\nspecifically to address your particular needs is always going to be well received.</p>\n<p>Let's not forget the social aspect, too. Despite the fact that we're a global community and work\ntogether remotely and asynchronously, it's still easier to work together when you have a personal\nconnection, and can put a face to a Github handle. Zoom meetings are a good start, but even a\nsingle instance of in-person time makes a big difference in how people work together. So, getting\nfolks together a couple times a year makes the project run more smoothly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organizing-the-summit\">Organizing the Summit</h2>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: In terms of the organization team itself, could you share with us a general overview of the\nstaffing process? Who are the people that make it happen? How many different teams are involved?</p>\n<p><strong>NA</strong>: There's a bit of the &quot;usual suspects&quot; involved in making this happen, many of whom you'll\nfind in the ContribEx meetings, but really it comes down to whoever is going to step up and do the\nwork. We start with a general call out for volunteers from the org. There's a Github issue where\nwe'll track the staffing and that will get shouted out to all the usual comms channels: slack,\nk-dev, etc.</p>\n<p>From there, there's a handful of different teams, overseeing content/program committee,\nregistration, communications, day-of operations, the awards the SIGs present to their members, the\nafter-summit social event, and so on. The leads for each team/role are generally picked from folks\nwho have stepped up and worked the event before, either as a shadow, or a previous lead, so we know\nwe can rely on them, which is a recurring theme. The leads pick their shadows from whoever pipes up\non the issue, and the teams move forward, operating according to their role books, which we try to\nupdate at the end of each summit, with what we've learned over the past few months. It's expected\nthat a shadow will be in line to lead that role at some point in a future summit, so we always have\na good bench of folks available to make this event happen. A couple of the roles also have some\nnon-shadow volunteers where people can step in to help a bit, like as an on-site room monitor, and\nget a feel for how things are put together without having to give a serious up-front commitment, but\nmost of the folks working the event are dedicated to both making the summit successful, and coming\nback to do so in the future. Of course, the roster can change over time, or even suddenly, as\npeople gain or lose travel budget, get new jobs, only attend Europe or North America or Asia, etc.\nIt's a constant dance, relying 100% on the people who want to make this project successful.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, is the Summit lead. They have to keep the entire process moving forward, be\nwilling to step in to keep bike-shedding from derailing our deadlines, make sure the right people\nare talking to one another, lead all our meetings to make sure everyone gets a voice, etc. In some\ncases, the lead has to even be willing to take over an entirely separate role, in case someone gets\nsick or has any other extenuating circumstances, to make sure absolutely nothing falls through the\ncracks. The lead is only allowed to volunteer after they’ve been through this a few times and know\nwhat the event entails. Event planning is not for the faint of heart.</p>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: The participation of volunteers is essential, but there's also the topic of CNCF support:\nhow does this dynamic play out in practice?</p>\n<p><strong>NA</strong>: This event would not happen in its current form without our CNCF liaison. They provide us\nwith space, make sure we are fed and caffeinated and cared for, bring us outside spaces to evaluate,\nso we have somewhere to hold the social gathering, get us the budget so we have t-shirts and patches\nand the like, and generally make it possible for us to put this event together. They're even\nresponsible for the signage and arrows, so the attendees know where to go. They're the ones sitting\nat the front desk, keeping an eye on everything and answering people's questions. At the same time,\nthey're along to facilitate, and try to avoid influencing our planning.</p>\n<p>There's a ton of work that goes into making the summit happen that is easy to overlook, as an\nattendee, because people tend to expect things to just work. It is not exaggerating to say this\nevent would not have happened like it has over the years, without the help from our liaisons, like\nBrienne and Deb. They are an integral part of the team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-look-ahead\">A look ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: Currently, we’re preparing the NA 2023 summit, how is it going? Any changes in format\ncompared with previous ones?</p>\n<p><strong>NA</strong>: I would say it's going great, though I'm sort of emeritus lead for this event, mostly\npicking up the things that I see need to be done and don't have someone assigned to it. We're\nalways learning from our past experiences and making small changes to continually be better, from\nhow many people need to be on a particular rotation to how far in advance we open and close the CFP.\nThere's no major changes right now, just continually providing the content that the contributors\nwant.</p>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: For our readers that might be interested in joining in the Kubernetes Contributor Summit, is\nthere anything they should know?</p>\n<p><strong>NA</strong>: First of all, the summit is an event by and for Org members. If you're not already an org\nmember, you should be getting involved before trying to attend the summit, as the content is curated\nspecifically towards the contributors and maintainers of the project. That applies to the staff, as\nwell, as all the decisions should be made with the interests and health of kubernetes contributors\nbeing the end goal. We get a lot of people who show interest in helping out, but then aren't ready\nto make any sort of commitment, and that just makes more work for us. If you're not already a\nproven and committed member of this community, it’s difficult for us to place you in a position that\nrequires reliability. We have made some rare exceptions when we need someone local to help us out,\nbut those are few and far between.</p>\n<p>If you are, however, already a member, we'd love to have you. The more people that are involved,\nthe better the event becomes. That applies to both dedicated staff, and those in attendance\nbringing CFPs, unconference topics, and just contributing to the discussions. If you're part of\nthis community and you're going to be at KubeCon, I would highly urge you to attend, and if you're\nnot yet an org member, let's make that happen!</p>\n<p><strong>FM</strong>: Indeed!

In this blog, we will cover the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/README.md#production-readiness-1\">SIG Architecture: Production Readiness\nsubproject</a></em>.</p>\n<p>In this SIG Architecture spotlight, we talked with <a href=\"https://github.com/wojtek-t\">Wojciech Tyczynski</a>\n(Google), lead of the Production Readiness subproject.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-architecture-and-the-production-readiness-subproject\">About SIG Architecture and the Production Readiness subproject</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico (FSM)</strong>: Hello Wojciech, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role and how you\ngot involved in Kubernetes?</p>\n<p><strong>Wojciech Tyczynski (WT)</strong>: I started contributing to Kubernetes in January 2015. At that time,\nGoogle (where I was and still am working) decided to start a Kubernetes team in the Warsaw office\n(in addition to already existing teams in California and Seattle). I was lucky enough to be one of\nthe seeding engineers for that team.</p>\n<p>After two months of onboarding and helping with different tasks across the project towards 1.0\nlaunch, I took ownership of the scalability area and I was leading Kubernetes to support clusters\nwith 5000 nodes. I’m still involved in <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/README.md\">SIG Scalability</a>\nas its Technical Lead. That was the start of a journey since scalability is such a cross-cutting topic,\nand I started contributing to many other areas including, over time, to SIG Architecture.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: In SIG Architecture, why specifically the Production Readiness subproject? Was it something\nyou had in mind from the start, or was it an unexpected consequence of your initial involvement in\nscalability?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: After reaching that milestone of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/03/scalability-updates-in-kubernetes-1-6/\">Kubernetes supporting 5000-node clusters</a>,\none of the goals was to ensure that Kubernetes would not degrade its scalability properties over time. While\nnon-scalable implementation is always fixable, designing non-scalable APIs or contracts is\nproblematic. I was looking for a way to ensure that people are thinking about\nscalability when they create new features and capabilities without introducing too much overhead.</p>\n<p>This is when I joined forces with <a href=\"https://github.com/johnbelamaric\">John Belamaric</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/deads2k\">David Eads</a> and created a Production Readiness subproject within SIG\nArchitecture. While setting the bar for scalability was only one of a few motivations for it, it\nended up fitting quite well. At the same time, I was already involved in the overall reliability of\nthe system internally, so other goals of Production Readiness were also close to my heart.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: To anyone new to how SIG Architecture works, how would you describe the main goals and\nareas of intervention of the Production Readiness subproject?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: The goal of the Production Readiness subproject is to ensure that any feature that is added\nto Kubernetes can be reliably used in production clusters. This primarily means that those features\nare observable, scalable, supportable, can always be safely enabled and in case of production issues\nalso disabled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"production-readiness-and-the-kubernetes-project\">Production readiness and the Kubernetes project</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Architectural consistency being one of the goals of the SIG, is this made more challenging\nby the <a href=\"https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-project-journey-report/\">distributed and open nature of Kubernetes</a>?\nDo you feel this impacts the approach that Production Readiness has to take?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: The distributed nature of Kubernetes certainly impacts Production Readiness, because it\nmakes thinking about aspects like enablement/disablement or scalability more challenging. To be more\nprecise, when enabling or disabling features that span multiple components you need to think about\nversion skew between them and design for it. For scalability, changes in one component may actually\nresult in problems for a completely different one, so it requires a good understanding of the whole\nsystem, not just individual components. But it’s also what makes this project so interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Those running Kubernetes in production will have their own perspective on things, how do\nyou capture this feedback?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: Fortunately, we aren’t talking about <em>&quot;them&quot;</em> here, we’re talking about <em>&quot;us&quot;</em>: all of us are\nworking for companies that are managing large fleets of Kubernetes clusters and we’re involved in\nthat too, so we suffer from those problems ourselves.</p>\n<p>So while we’re trying to get feedback (our annual PRR survey is very important for us), it rarely\nreveals completely new problems - it rather shows the scale of them. And we try to react to it -\nchanges like &quot;Beta APIs off by default&quot; happen in reaction to the data that we observe.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: On the topic of reaction, that made me think of how the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md\">Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP)</a>\ntemplate has a Production Readiness Review (PRR) section, which is tied to the graduation\nprocess. Was this something born out of identified insufficiencies? How would you describe the\nresults?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: As mentioned above, the overall goal of the Production Readiness subproject is to ensure\nthat every newly added feature can be reliably used in production. It’s not possible to enforce that\nby a central team - we need to make it everyone's problem.</p>\n<p>To achieve it, we wanted to ensure that everyone designing their new feature is thinking about safe\nenablement, scalability, observability, supportability, etc. from the very beginning. Which means\nnot when the implementation starts, but rather during the design. Given that KEPs are effectively\nKubernetes design docs, making it part of the KEP template was the way to achieve the goal.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: So, in a way making sure that feature owners have thought about the implications of their\nproposal.</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: Exactly. We already observed that just by forcing feature owners to think through the PRR\naspects (via forcing them to fill in the PRR questionnaire) many of the original issues are going\naway. Sure - as PRR approvers we’re still catching gaps, but even the initial versions of KEPs are\nbetter now than they used to be a couple of years ago in what concerns thinking about\nproductionisation aspects, which is exactly what we wanted to achieve - spreading the culture of\nthinking about reliability in its widest possible meaning.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: We've been talking about the PRR process, could you describe it for our readers?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/production-readiness.md\">PRR process</a>\nis fairly simple - we just want to ensure that you think through the productionisation aspects of\nyour feature early enough. If you do your job, it’s just a matter of answering some questions in the\nKEP template and getting approval from a PRR approver (in addition to regular SIG approval). If you\ndidn’t think about those aspects earlier, it may require spending more time and potentially revising\nsome decisions, but that’s exactly what we need to make the Kubernetes project reliable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"helping-with-production-readiness\">Helping with Production Readiness</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Production Readiness seems to be one area where a good deal of prior exposure is required\nin order to be an effective contributor. Are there also ways for someone newer to the project to\ncontribute?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: PRR approvers have to have a deep understanding of the whole Kubernetes project to catch\npotential issues. Kubernetes is such a large project now with so many nuances that people who are\nnew to the project can simply miss the context, no matter how senior they are.</p>\n<p>That said, there are many ways that you may implicitly help. Increasing the reliability of\nparticular areas of the project by improving its observability and debuggability, increasing test\ncoverage, and building new kinds of tests (upgrade, downgrade, chaos, etc.) will help us a lot. Note\nthat the PRR subproject is focused on keeping the bar at the design level, but we should also care\nequally about the implementation. For that, we’re relying on individual SIGs and code approvers, so\nhaving people there who are aware of productionisation aspects, and who deeply care about it, will\nhelp the project a lot.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Thank you! Any final comments you would like to share with our readers?</p>\n<p><strong>WT</strong>: I would like to highlight and thank all contributors for their cooperation. While the PRR\nadds some additional work for them, we see that people care about it, and what’s even more\nencouraging is that with every release the quality of the answers improves, and questions &quot;do I\nreally need a metric reflecting if my feature works&quot; or &quot;is downgrade really that important&quot; don’t\nreally appear anymore.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-11-02 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/11/02/sig-architecture-production-readiness-spotlight-2023/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":30,"skip":630,"numPages":193,"currentPage":22}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

Cloud providers are\ngenerally using their own Kubernetes distributions and therefore they don't use\npackages provided by the Kubernetes project; more importantly, if someone else is\nmanaging Kubernetes for you, then they would usually take responsibility for that check.</p>\n<p>If you have a managed <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components\">control plane</a>\nbut you are responsible for <strong>managing the nodes yourself</strong>, and any of those nodes run Linux,\nyou should <a href=\"#check-if-affected\">check</a> whether you are affected.</p>\n<p>If you're managing your clusters on your own by following the official installation\nand upgrade instructions, please follow the instructions in this blog post to migrate\nto the (new) community-owned package repositories.</p>\n<p>If you're using a Kubernetes installer that's using packages provided by the\nKubernetes project, please check the installer tool's communication channels for\ninformation about what steps you need to take, and eventually if needed, follow up\nwith maintainers to let them know about this change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-this-affect-me-as-a-kubernetes-distributor\">How does this affect me as a Kubernetes distributor?</h2>\n<p>If you're using the legacy repositories as part of your project (e.g. a Kubernetes\ninstaller tool), you should migrate to the community-owned repositories as soon as\npossible and inform your users about this change and what steps they need to take.</p>\n<h2 id=\"timeline-of-changes\">Timeline of changes</h2>\n<!-- note to maintainers - the trailing whitespace is significant -->\n<ul>\n<li><strong>15th August 2023:</strong><br>\nKubernetes announces a new, community-managed source for Linux software packages of Kubernetes components</li>\n<li><strong>31st August 2023:</strong><br>\n<em>(this announcement)</em> Kubernetes formally deprecates the legacy\npackage repositories</li>\n<li><strong>13th September 2023</strong> (approximately):<br>\nKubernetes will freeze the legacy package repositories,\n(<code>apt.kubernetes.io</code> and <code>yum.kubernetes.io</code>).\nThe freeze will happen immediately following the patch releases that are scheduled for September, 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Kubernetes patch releases scheduled for September 2023 (v1.28.2, v1.27.6,\nv1.26.9, v1.25.14) will have packages published <strong>both</strong> to the community-owned and\nthe legacy repositories.</p>\n<p>We'll freeze the legacy repositories after cutting the patch releases for September\nwhich means that we'll completely stop publishing packages to the legacy repositories\nat that point.</p>\n<p>For the v1.28, v1.27, v1.26, and v1.25 patch releases from October 2023 and onwards,\nwe'll only publish packages to the new package repositories (<code>pkgs.k8s.io</code>).</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-future-minor-releases\">What about future minor releases?</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.29 and onwards will have packages published <strong>only</strong> to the\ncommunity-owned repositories (<code>pkgs.k8s.io</code>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"can-i-continue-to-use-the-legacy-package-repositories\">Can I continue to use the legacy package repositories?</h2>\n<p>The existing packages in the legacy repositories will be available for the foreseeable\nfuture.

The deprecated legacy repositories, and their contents, might\nbe removed at any time in the future and without a further notice period.</p>\n<p>The Kubernetes project <strong>strongly recommends</strong> migrating to the new community-owned\nrepositories <strong>as soon as possible</strong>.</p>\n<p>Given that no new releases will be published to the legacy repositories <strong>after the September 13, 2023</strong>\ncut-off point, <strong>you will not be able to upgrade to any patch or minor release made from that date onwards.</strong></p>\n<p>Whilst the project makes every effort to release secure software, there may one\nday be a high-severity vulnerability in Kubernetes, and consequently an important\nrelease to upgrade to.

Following in the footsteps of\nmigrating to our community-managed registry, <code>registry.k8s.io</code>, we are now migrating the\nKubernetes package repositories to our own community-managed infrastructure. We’re\nthankful to Google for their continuous hosting and support all these years, but\nthis transition marks another big milestone for the project’s goal of migrating\nto complete community-owned infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-there-a-kubernetes-tool-to-help-me-migrate\">Is there a Kubernetes tool to help me migrate?</h2>\n<p>We don't have any announcement to make about tooling there. As a Kubernetes user, you\nhave to manually modify your configuration to use the new repositories. Automating\nthe migration from the legacy to the community-owned repositories is technically\nchallenging and we want to avoid any potential risks associated with this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2>\n<p>First of all, we want to acknowledge the contributions from Alphabet. Staff at Google\nhave provided their time; Google as a business has provided both the infrastructure\nto serve packages, and the security context for giving those packages trustworthy\ndigital signatures.\nThese have been important to the adoption and growth of Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Releasing software might not be glamorous but it's important. Many people within\nthe Kubernetes contributor community have contributed to the new way that we, as a\nproject, have for building and publishing packages.</p>\n<p>And finally, we want to once again acknowledge the help from SUSE. OpenBuildService,\nfrom SUSE, is the technology that the powers the new community-managed package repositories.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 22:30:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/31/legacy-package-repository-deprecation/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4501,"Title":"Cloudflare Radar’s 2023 overview of new tools and insights","Description":"In this reading list, we want to highlight some of the new additions to Radar, as well as some of the Internet disruptions and trends we’ve observed and published posts about during this year","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 16:33:55+00:00","OriginURL":"http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radars-2023-overview-of-new-tools-and-insights/","SourceName":"Cloudflare"}},{"node":{"ID":5349,"Title":"Cloudflare Radar’s 2023 overview of new tools and insights","Description":" In this reading list, we want to highlight some of the new additions to Radar, as well as some of the Internet disruptions and trends we’ve observed and published posts about during this year ","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 16:33:55+00:00","OriginURL":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radars-2023-overview-of-new-tools-and-insights","SourceName":"Cloudflare"}},{"node":{"ID":5451,"Title":"Cloudflare Radar’s 2023 overview of new tools and insights","Description":" In this reading list, we want to highlight some of the new additions to Radar, as well as some of the Internet disruptions and trends we’ve observed and published posts about during this year ","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 16:33:55+00:00","OriginURL":"https://staging.blog.mrk.cfdata.org/cloudflare-radars-2023-overview-of-new-tools-and-insights","SourceName":"Cloudflare"}},{"node":{"ID":4499,"Title":"How GitHub reduces costs with upgraded Codespaces","Description":"<p>See how much more you can get out of GitHub Codespaces by taking advantage of the improved processing power and increased headroom the RAM provides.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.blog/2023-08-31-how-github-reduces-costs-with-upgraded-codespaces/\">How GitHub reduces costs with upgraded Codespaces</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.blog\">The GitHub Blog</a>.</p>\n","PublishedAt":"2023-08-31 15:00:52+00:00","OriginURL":"https://github.blog/2023-08-31-how-github-reduces-costs-with-upgraded-codespaces/","SourceName":"GitHub"}},{"node":{"ID":4502,"Title":"Enhancing Security and Developer Productivity: LinkedIn's Journey with Implementing Content Security Policy","Description":"LinkedIn Information Security is committed to help foster a community that is safe and secure for our members.

Due to their high-performance capabilities, NVIDIA&rsquo;s discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) now account for approximately 80 percent of the market share for production-level AI, gaming, graphics rendering, and other complex data processing tasks. In these environments, GPUs are required because of their ability to handle parallel computing, which CPUs alone cannot do effectively.","PublishedAt":"2023-07-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-nvidia-gpus-with-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4177,"Title":"How to index data into Elasticsearch from Confluent Cloud","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-07-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/index-data-elasticsearch-confluent-cloud","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4183,"Title":"Query unsampled logs in real time with Live Search","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/live-search-log-management/live-search-log-management-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>With thousands of logs generated every minute from your infrastructure, applications, services, and devices, retaining this copious amount of data for active search and analysis can be cost-prohibitive. Because log volumes continue to grow rapidly as operations scale, it&rsquo;s common for organizations to implement log management strategies and store only a limited number to minimize costs. Deciding which logs need to be stored and analyzed can be highly complex, and retaining only a subset of logs can make it challenging to troubleshoot effectively.","PublishedAt":"2023-07-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/live-search-log-management/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4167,"Title":"Analyzing Time Series for Pinterest Observability","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-07-18 16:01:18+00:00","OriginURL":"https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/analyzing-time-series-for-pinterest-observability-95f8cc0c5885?source=rss----4c5a5f6279b6---4","SourceName":"Pinterest"}},{"node":{"ID":4166,"Title":"DDoS threat report for 2023 Q2","Description":"Q2 2023 saw an unprecedented escalation in DDoS attack sophistication.

Approximately 90% of organizations use open source software to support their services, but monitoring these dependencies can be difficult when environments run thousands of ephemeral services. The complex nature of modern applications, in combination with the challenge of keeping a competitive edge in a fast-moving market, can make it difficult for organizations to identify and remediate threats in a timely manner.","PublishedAt":"2023-02-16 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-application-risk-management/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":2988,"Title":"Elastic Stack 8.6.2 released","Description":"<p>Version 8.6.2 of the Elastic Stack was released today.

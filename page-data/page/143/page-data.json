We are happy to announce that this feature has graduated to General Availability (GA) status in Kubernetes 1.25.</p>\n<p>CSI Inline Volumes are similar to other ephemeral volume types, such as <code>configMap</code>, <code>downwardAPI</code> and <code>secret</code>. The important difference is that the storage is provided by a CSI driver, which allows the use of ephemeral storage provided by third-party vendors. The volume is defined as part of the pod spec and follows the lifecycle of the pod, meaning the volume is created once the pod is scheduled and destroyed when the pod is destroyed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-1-25\">What's new in 1.25?</h2>\n<p>There are a couple of new bug fixes related to this feature in 1.25, and the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">CSIInlineVolume feature gate</a> has been locked to <code>True</code> with the graduation to GA. There are no new API changes, so users of this feature during beta should not notice any significant changes aside from these bug fixes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/89290\">#89290 - CSI inline volumes should support fsGroup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/79980\">#79980 - CSI volume reconstruction does not work for ephemeral volumes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-this-feature\">When to use this feature</h2>\n<p>CSI inline volumes are meant for simple local volumes that should follow the lifecycle of the pod. They may be useful for providing secrets, configuration data, or other special-purpose storage to the pod from a CSI driver.</p>\n<p>A CSI driver is not suitable for inline use when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The volume needs to persist longer than the lifecycle of a pod</li>\n<li>Volume snapshots, cloning, or volume expansion are required</li>\n<li>The CSI driver requires <code>volumeAttributes</code> that should be restricted to an administrator</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-this-feature\">How to use this feature</h2>\n<p>In order to use this feature, the <code>CSIDriver</code> spec must explicitly list <code>Ephemeral</code> as one of the supported <code>volumeLifecycleModes</code>. Here is a simple example from the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver\">Secrets Store CSI Driver</a>.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1\nkind: CSIDriver\nmetadata:\nname: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io\nspec:\npodInfoOnMount: true\nattachRequired: false\nvolumeLifecycleModes:\n- Ephemeral\n</code></pre><p>Any pod spec may then reference that CSI driver to create an inline volume, as in this example.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>kind: Pod\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\nname: my-csi-app-inline\nspec:\ncontainers:\n- name: my-frontend\nimage: busybox\nvolumeMounts:\n- name: secrets-store-inline\nmountPath: &#34;/mnt/secrets-store&#34;\nreadOnly: true\ncommand: [ &#34;sleep&#34;, &#34;1000000&#34; ]\nvolumes:\n- name: secrets-store-inline\ncsi:\ndriver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io\nreadOnly: true\nvolumeAttributes:\nsecretProviderClass: &#34;my-provider&#34;\n</code></pre><p>If the driver supports any volume attributes, you can provide these as part of the <code>spec</code> for the Pod as well:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code> csi:\ndriver: block.csi.vendor.example\nvolumeAttributes:\nfoo: bar\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"example-use-cases\">Example Use Cases</h2>\n<p>Two existing CSI drivers that support the <code>Ephemeral</code> volume lifecycle mode are the Secrets Store CSI Driver and the Cert-Manager CSI Driver.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver\">Secrets Store CSI Driver</a> allows users to mount secrets from external secret stores into a pod as an inline volume. This can be useful when the secrets are stored in an external managed service or Vault instance.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/cert-manager/csi-driver\">Cert-Manager CSI Driver</a> works along with <a href=\"https://cert-manager.io/\">cert-manager</a> to seamlessly request and mount certificate key pairs into a pod. This allows the certificates to be renewed and updated in the application pod automatically.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security-considerations\">Security Considerations</h2>\n<p>Special consideration should be given to which CSI drivers may be used as inline volumes. <code>volumeAttributes</code> are typically controlled through the <code>StorageClass</code>, and may contain attributes that should remain restricted to the cluster administrator. Allowing a CSI driver to be used for inline ephmeral volumes means that any user with permission to create pods may also provide <code>volumeAttributes</code> to the driver through a pod spec.</p>\n<p>Cluster administrators may choose to omit (or remove) <code>Ephemeral</code> from <code>volumeLifecycleModes</code> in the CSIDriver spec to prevent the driver from being used as an inline ephemeral volume, or use an <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/\">admission webhook</a> to restrict how the driver is used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<p>For more information on this feature, see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#csi-ephemeral-volumes\">Kubernetes documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html\">CSI documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-storage/596-csi-inline-volumes/README.md\">KEP-596</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/01/21/csi-ephemeral-inline-volumes/\">Beta blog post for CSI Inline Volumes</a></li>\n</ul>","PublishedAt":"2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/29/csi-inline-volumes-ga/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":1473,"Title":"How telecom leaders can use sustainable cybersecurity practices to achieve their ESG goals","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-08-29 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-telecom-leaders-can-use-sustainable-cybersecurity-practices-to-achieve-their-esg-goals","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":1475,"Title":"Monitor your Microsoft Azure VMs featuring Ampere Altra Arm-based CPUs with Datadog","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitor-azure-arm-vms-datadog/Azure-Arm-based-VMs_integration_220808_FINAL.png\" width=\"100%\"/>As organizations continue to expand their cloud footprint, managing costs without risking application performance is a priority.

The Pod Security Standards are maintained by the K8s\ncommunity, which means you automatically get updated security policies whenever new\nsecurity-impacting Kubernetes features are introduced.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-since-beta\">What’s new since Beta?</h2>\n<p>Pod Security Admission hasn’t changed much since the Beta in Kubernetes v1.23. The focus has been on\nimproving the user experience, while continuing to maintain a high quality bar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"improved-violation-messages\">Improved violation messages</h3>\n<p>We improved violation messages so that you get\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107698\">fewer duplicate messages</a>. For example,\ninstead of the following message when the Baseline and Restricted policies check the same\ncapability:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>pods &#34;admin-pod&#34; is forbidden: violates PodSecurity &#34;restricted:latest&#34;: non-default capabilities (container &#34;admin&#34; must not include &#34;SYS_ADMIN&#34; in securityContext.capabilities.add), unrestricted capabilities (container &#34;admin&#34; must not include &#34;SYS_ADMIN&#34; in securityContext.capabilities.add)\n</code></pre><p>You get this message:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>pods &#34;admin-pod&#34; is forbidden: violates PodSecurity &#34;restricted:latest&#34;: unrestricted capabilities (container &#34;admin&#34; must not include &#34;SYS_ADMIN&#34; in securityContext.capabilities.add)\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"improved-namespace-warnings\">Improved namespace warnings</h3>\n<p>When you modify the <code>enforce</code> Pod Security labels on a namespace, the Pod Security\nadmission controller checks all existing pods for\nviolations and surfaces a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/03/warnings/\">warning</a> if any are out of compliance. These\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105889\">warnings are now aggregated</a> for pods with\nidentical violations, making large namespaces with many replicas much more manageable.

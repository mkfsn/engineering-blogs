But as teams grow, it can become impractical for them to manually configure each new application with the libraries and environment variables needed for tracing. Traditionally, this manual configuration has required developers to build a new application image with the appropriate tracing library installed—a process that activates a CI/CD pipeline and brings development to a temporary halt.","PublishedAt":"2023-01-30 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/auto-instrument-kubernetes-tracing-with-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":2847,"Title":"Adding security to Nuxt 3","Description":"In this article, I would like to introduce you to the new Nuxt module that I recently created that should help you build more secure Nuxt applications.","PublishedAt":"2023-01-27 16:23:17+00:00","OriginURL":"https://snyk.io/blog/adding-security-to-nuxt-3/","SourceName":"Snyk"}},{"node":{"ID":2846,"Title":"The Benefits of Setting Goals and Tips For Sticking to Them","Description":"<p>Does it ever feel like you’re spinning your wheels but not getting anywhere?

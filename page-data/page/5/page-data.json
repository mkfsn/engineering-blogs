With this type of architecture, teams often don&rsquo;t know exactly where vulnerabilities exist in their code, which of those vulnerabilities are actively exposed in production services, and which vulnerabilities are more critical to address than others. Fixing a vulnerability often requires taking valuable time away from developing and shipping new features in order to conduct arduous investigations and manually resolve each and every vulnerability.","PublishedAt":"2024-02-15 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-software-composition-analysis/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":5640,"Title":"Measure long-term user engagement with Datadog Retention Analysis","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/user-engagement-retention-analysis/retention-analysis-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>It’s relatively easy to study the immediate impact of new releases by analyzing short-term changes in user behavior or system activity.

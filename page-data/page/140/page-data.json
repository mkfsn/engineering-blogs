These chains\nwere never intended to be part of any Kubernetes API/ABI guarantees,\nbut some external components nonetheless make use of some of them (in\nparticular, using <code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code> to mark packets as needing to be\nmasqueraded).</p>\n<p>As a part of the v1.25 release, SIG Network made this declaration\nexplicit: that (with one exception), the iptables chains that\nKubernetes creates are intended only for Kubernetes’s own internal\nuse, and third-party components should not assume that Kubernetes will\ncreate any specific iptables chains, or that those chains will contain\nany specific rules if they do exist.</p>\n<p>Then, in future releases, as part of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3178\">KEP-3178</a>, we will begin phasing\nout certain chains that Kubernetes itself no longer needs. Components\noutside of Kubernetes itself that make use of <code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code>,\n<code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code>, or other Kubernetes-generated iptables chains should\nstart migrating away from them now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>In addition to various service-specific iptables chains, kube-proxy\ncreates certain general-purpose iptables chains that it uses as part\nof service proxying. In the past, kubelet also used iptables for a few\nfeatures (such as setting up <code>hostPort</code> mapping for pods) and so it\nalso redundantly created some of the same chains.</p>\n<p>However, with <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/\">the removal of dockershim</a> in Kubernetes in 1.24,\nkubelet now no longer ever uses any iptables rules for its own\npurposes; the things that it used to use iptables for are now always\nthe responsibility of the container runtime or the network plugin, and\nthere is no reason for kubelet to be creating any iptables rules.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, although <code>iptables</code> is still the default kube-proxy backend\non Linux, it is unlikely to remain the default forever, since the\nassociated command-line tools and kernel APIs are essentially\ndeprecated, and no longer receiving improvements. (RHEL 9\n<a href=\"https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6739041\">logs a warning</a> if you use the iptables API, even via\n<code>iptables-nft</code>.)</p>\n<p>Although as of Kubernetes 1.25 iptables kube-proxy remains popular,\nand kubelet continues to create the iptables rules that it\nhistorically created (despite no longer <em>using</em> them), third party\nsoftware cannot assume that core Kubernetes components will keep\ncreating these rules in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upcoming-changes\">Upcoming changes</h2>\n<p>Starting a few releases from now, kubelet will no longer create the\nfollowing iptables chains in the <code>nat</code> table:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code></li>\n<li><code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code></li>\n<li><code>KUBE-POSTROUTING</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the <code>KUBE-FIREWALL</code> chain in the <code>filter</code> table will no\nlonger have the functionality currently associated with\n<code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code> (and it may eventually go away entirely).</p>\n<p>This change will be phased in via the <code>IPTablesOwnershipCleanup</code>\nfeature gate. That feature gate is available and can be manually\nenabled for testing in Kubernetes 1.25. The current plan is that it\nwill become enabled-by-default in Kubernetes 1.27, though this may be\ndelayed to a later release. (It will not happen sooner than Kubernetes\n1.27.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-do-if-you-use-kubernetes-s-iptables-chains\">What to do if you use Kubernetes’s iptables chains</h2>\n<p>(Although the discussion below focuses on short-term fixes that are\nstill based on iptables, you should probably also start thinking about\neventually migrating to nftables or another API).</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-case-kube-mark-masq\">If you use <code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code>...</h3>\n<p>If you are making use of the <code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code> chain to cause packets\nto be masqueraded, you have two options: (1) rewrite your rules to use\n<code>-j MASQUERADE</code> directly, (2) create your own alternative “mark for\nmasquerade” chain.</p>\n<p>The reason kube-proxy uses <code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code> is because there are lots\nof cases where it needs to call both <code>-j DNAT</code> and <code>-j MASQUERADE</code> on\na packet, but it’s not possible to do both of those at the same time\nin iptables; <code>DNAT</code> must be called from the <code>PREROUTING</code> (or <code>OUTPUT</code>)\nchain (because it potentially changes where the packet will be routed\nto) while <code>MASQUERADE</code> must be called from <code>POSTROUTING</code> (because the\nmasqueraded source IP that it picks depends on what the final routing\ndecision was).</p>\n<p>In theory, kube-proxy could have one set of rules to match packets in\n<code>PREROUTING</code>/<code>OUTPUT</code> and call <code>-j DNAT</code>, and then have a second set\nof rules to match the same packets in <code>POSTROUTING</code> and call <code>-j MASQUERADE</code>. But instead, for efficiency, it only matches them once,\nduring <code>PREROUTING</code>/<code>OUTPUT</code>, at which point it calls <code>-j DNAT</code> and\nthen calls <code>-j KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code> to set a bit on the kernel packet mark\nas a reminder to itself. Then later, during <code>POSTROUTING</code>, it has a\nsingle rule that matches all previously-marked packets, and calls <code>-j MASQUERADE</code> on them.</p>\n<p>If you have <em>a lot</em> of rules where you need to apply both DNAT and\nmasquerading to the same packets like kube-proxy does, then you may\nwant a similar arrangement. But in many cases, components that use\n<code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code> are only doing it because they copied kube-proxy’s\nbehavior without understanding why kube-proxy was doing it that way.\nMany of these components could easily be rewritten to just use\nseparate DNAT and masquerade rules. (In cases where no DNAT is\noccurring then there is even less point to using <code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code>;\njust move your rules from <code>PREROUTING</code> to <code>POSTROUTING</code> and call <code>-j MASQUERADE</code> directly.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-case-kube-mark-drop\">If you use <code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code>...</h3>\n<p>The rationale for <code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code> is similar to the rationale for\n<code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code>: kube-proxy wanted to make packet-dropping decisions\nalongside other decisions in the <code>nat</code> <code>KUBE-SERVICES</code> chain, but you\ncan only call <code>-j DROP</code> from the <code>filter</code> table. So instead, it uses\n<code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code> to mark packets to be dropped later on.</p>\n<p>In general, the approach for removing a dependency on <code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code>\nis the same as for removing a dependency on <code>KUBE-MARK-MASQ</code>. In\nkube-proxy’s case, it is actually quite easy to replace the usage of\n<code>KUBE-MARK-DROP</code> in the <code>nat</code> table with direct calls to <code>DROP</code> in the\n<code>filter</code> table, because there are no complicated interactions between\nDNAT rules and drop rules, and so the drop rules can simply be moved\nfrom <code>nat</code> to <code>filter</code>.</p>\n<p>In more complicated cases, it might be necessary to “re-match” the\nsame packets in both <code>nat</code> and <code>filter</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-case-iptables-mode\">If you use Kubelet’s iptables rules to figure out <code>iptables-legacy</code> vs <code>iptables-nft</code>...</h3>\n<p>Components that manipulate host-network-namespace iptables rules from\ninside a container need some way to figure out whether the host is\nusing the old <code>iptables-legacy</code> binaries or the newer <code>iptables-nft</code>\nbinaries (which talk to a different kernel API underneath).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/iptables-wrappers/\"><code>iptables-wrappers</code></a> module provides a way for such components to\nautodetect the system iptables mode, but in the past it did this by\nassuming that Kubelet will have created “a bunch” of iptables rules\nbefore any containers start, and so it can guess which mode the\niptables binaries in the host filesystem are using by seeing which\nmode has more rules defined.</p>\n<p>In future releases, Kubelet will no longer create many iptables rules,\nso heuristics based on counting the number of rules present may fail.</p>\n<p>However, as of 1.24, Kubelet always creates a chain named\n<code>KUBE-IPTABLES-HINT</code> in the <code>mangle</code> table of whichever iptables\nsubsystem it is using. Components can now look for this specific chain\nto know which iptables subsystem Kubelet (and thus, presumably, the\nrest of the system) is using.</p>\n<p>(Additionally, since Kubernetes 1.17, kubelet has created a chain\ncalled <code>KUBE-KUBELET-CANARY</code> in the <code>mangle</code> table. While this chain\nmay go away in the future, it will of course still be there in older\nreleases, so in any recent version of Kubernetes, at least one of\n<code>KUBE-IPTABLES-HINT</code> or <code>KUBE-KUBELET-CANARY</code> will be present.)</p>\n<p>The <code>iptables-wrappers</code> package has <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/iptables-wrappers/pull/3\">already been updated</a> with this new\nheuristic, so if you were previously using that, you can rebuild your\ncontainer images with an updated version of that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further-reading\">Further reading</h2>\n<p>The project to clean up iptables chain ownership and deprecate the old\nchains is tracked by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3178\">KEP-3178</a>.</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-09-07 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/07/iptables-chains-not-api/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":1589,"Title":"Why CISOs are the new champions of insurance transformation","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-09-07 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-cisos-are-the-new-champions-of-insurance-transformation","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":1591,"Title":"Monitor user-facing bugs with LambdaTest’s subscription in the Datadog Marketplace","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitor-user-bugs-with-lambdatest/hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>As your products and client base scale, maintaining effective test suites and providing rapid response to user-facing issues becomes increasingly challenging.

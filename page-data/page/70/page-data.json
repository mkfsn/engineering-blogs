KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to\nperform this encryption.</p>\n<p>KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version 1.10, and is currently in beta as of version\nv1.12. KMS v2 was introduced as alpha in v1.25.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-primary\" role=\"alert\">\n<h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Note</h4>\nThe KMS v2 API and implementation changed in incompatible\nways in-between the alpha release in v1.25 and the beta release in v1.27. The design of KMS v2 has\nchanged since <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/09/kms-v2-improvements/\">the previous blog post</a>\nwas written and it is not compatible with the design in this blog post. Attempting to upgrade from\nold versions with the alpha feature enabled will result in data loss.\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-v2beta1\">What’s new in <code>v2beta1</code>?</h2>\n<p>The KMS encryption provider uses an envelope encryption scheme to encrypt data in etcd. The data is\nencrypted using a data encryption key (DEK). The DEKs are encrypted with a key encryption key (KEK)\nthat is stored and managed in a remote KMS. With KMS v1, a new DEK is generated for each encryption.\nWith KMS v2, a new DEK is only generated on server startup and when the KMS plugin informs the API\nserver that a KEK rotation has occurred.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-warning\" role=\"alert\">\n<h4 class=\"alert-heading\">Caution</h4>\n<p>If you are running virtual machine (VM) based nodes\nthat leverage VM state store with this feature, you must not use KMS v2.</p>\n<p>With KMS v2, the API server uses AES-GCM with a 12 byte nonce (8 byte atomic counter and 4 bytes\nrandom data) for encryption. The following issues could occur if the VM is saved and restored:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The counter value may be lost or corrupted if the VM is saved in an inconsistent state or\nrestored improperly. This can lead to a situation where the same counter value is used twice,\nresulting in the same nonce being used for two different messages.</li>\n<li>If the VM is restored to a previous state, the counter value may be set back to its previous\nvalue, resulting in the same nonce being used again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although both of these cases are partially mitigated by the 4 byte random nonce, this can compromise\nthe security of the encryption.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"sequence-diagram\">Sequence Diagram</h3>\n<h4 id=\"encrypt-request\">Encrypt Request</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant user\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nalt Generate DEK at startup\nNote over kube_api_server,external_kms: Refer to Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK) diagram for details\nend\nuser->>kube_api_server: create/update resource that's to be encrypted\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: encrypt resource with DEK\nkube_api_server->>etcd: store encrypted object\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-encryption.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Encrypt\"/>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"decrypt-request\">Decrypt Request</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant user\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nparticipant etcd\nuser->>kube_api_server: get/list resource that's encrypted\nkube_api_server->>etcd: get encrypted resource\netcd->>kube_api_server: encrypted resource\nalt Encrypted DEK not in cache\nkube_api_server->>kms_plugin: decrypt request\nkms_plugin->>external_kms: decrypt DEK with remote KEK\nexternal_kms->>kms_plugin: decrypted DEK\nkms_plugin->>kube_api_server: return decrypted DEK\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: cache decrypted DEK\nend\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: decrypt resource with DEK\nkube_api_server->>user: return decrypted resource\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-decryption.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Decrypt\"/>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"status-request\">Status Request</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nalt Generate DEK at startup\nNote over kube_api_server,external_kms: Refer to Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK) diagram for details\nend\nloop every minute (or every 10s if error or unhealthy)\nkube_api_server->>kms_plugin: status request\nkms_plugin->>external_kms: validate remote KEK\nexternal_kms->>kms_plugin: KEK status\nkms_plugin->>kube_api_server: return status response <br/> {\"healthz\": \"ok\", key_id: \"<remote KEK ID>\", \"version\": \"v2beta1\"}\nalt KEK rotation detected (key_id changed), rotate DEK\nNote over kube_api_server,external_kms: Refer to Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK) diagram for details\nend\nend\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-status.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Status\"/>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"generate-data-encryption-key-dek\">Generate Data Encryption Key (DEK)</h4>\n<!-- source\n```mermaid\n%%{init:{\"theme\":\"neutral\", \"sequence\": {\"mirrorActors\":true},\n\"themeVariables\": {\n\"actorBkg\":\"royalblue\",\n\"actorTextColor\":\"white\"\n}}}%%\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant kube_api_server\nparticipant kms_plugin\nparticipant external_kms\nkube_api_server->>kube_api_server: generate DEK\nkube_api_server->>kms_plugin: encrypt request\nkms_plugin->>external_kms: encrypt DEK with remote KEK\nexternal_kms->>kms_plugin: encrypted DEK\nkms_plugin->>kube_api_server: return encrypt response <br/> {\"ciphertext\": \"<encrypted DEK>\", key_id: \"<remote KEK ID>\", \"annotations\": {}}\n```\n-->\n<figure class=\"diagram-large\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/images/blog/2023-05-16-kubernetes-1.27-kmsv2-beta/kubernetes-1.27-generate-dek.svg\"\nalt=\"Sequence diagram for KMSv2 beta Generate DEK\"/>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"performance-improvements\">Performance Improvements</h3>\n<p>With KMS v2, we have made significant improvements to the performance of the KMS encryption\nprovider. In case of KMS v1, a new DEK is generated for every encryption. This means that for every\nwrite request, the API server makes a call to the KMS plugin to encrypt the DEK using the remote\nKEK. The API server also has to cache the DEKs to avoid making a call to the KMS plugin for every\nread request. When the API server restarts, it has to populate the cache by making a call to the KMS\nplugin for every DEK in the etcd store based on the cache size. This is a significant overhead for\nthe API server. With KMS v2, the API server generates a DEK at startup and caches it. The API server\nalso makes a call to the KMS plugin to encrypt the DEK using the remote KEK. This is a one-time call\nat startup and on KEK rotation. The API server then uses the cached DEK to encrypt the resources.\nThis reduces the number of calls to the KMS plugin and improves the overall latency of the API\nserver requests.</p>\n<p>We conducted a test that created 12k secrets and measured the time taken for the API server to\nencrypt the resources. The metric used was\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/\"><code>apiserver_storage_transformation_duration_seconds</code></a>.\nFor KMS v1, the test was run on a managed Kubernetes v1.25 cluster with 2 nodes. There was no\nadditional load on the cluster during the test. For KMS v2, the test was run in the Kubernetes CI\nenvironment with the following <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.27/test/e2e/testing-manifests/auth/encrypt/kind.yaml\">cluster\nconfiguration</a>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>KMS Provider</th>\n<th>Time taken by 95 percentile</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>KMS v1</td>\n<td>160ms</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KMS v2</td>\n<td>80μs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The results show that the KMS v2 encryption provider is three orders of magnitude faster than the\nKMS v1 encryption provider.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-next\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>For Kubernetes v1.28, we expect the feature to stay in beta. In the coming releases we want to\ninvestigate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cryptographic changes to remove the limitation on VM state store.</li>\n<li>Kubernetes REST API changes to enable a more robust story around key rotation.</li>\n<li>Handling undecryptable resources. Refer to the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3927\">KEP</a> for details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can learn more about KMS v2 by reading <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kms-provider/\">Using a KMS provider for data\nencryption</a>.

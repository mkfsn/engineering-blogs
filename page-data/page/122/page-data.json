Especially the chapter about\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/10/20/advanced-server-side-apply/#ci-cd-systems\">CI/CD systems</a>\nmotivated me to respond and write down my thoughts and experiences.</p>\n<p>These thoughts and experiences are the results of me working on <a href=\"https://kluctl.io\">Kluctl</a>\nfor the past 2 years. I describe Kluctl as &quot;The missing glue to put together\nlarge Kubernetes deployments, composed of multiple smaller parts\n(Helm/Kustomize/...) in a manageable and unified way.&quot;</p>\n<p>To get a basic understanding of Kluctl, I suggest to visit the <a href=\"https://kluctlio\">kluctl.io</a>\nwebsite and read through the documentation and tutorials, for example the\n<a href=\"https://kluctl.io/docs/guides/tutorials/microservices-demo/\">microservices demo tutorial</a>.\nAs an alternative, you can watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LoYLjDjOdg\">Hands-on Introduction to kluctl</a>\nfrom the Rawkode Academy YouTube channel which shows a hands-on demo session.</p>\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"https://github.com/codablock/podtato-head/tree/kluctl/delivery/kluctl\">Kluctl delivery scenario</a>\navailable in my fork of the <a href=\"https://github.com/codablock/podtato-head\">podtato-head</a> demo project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"live-and-let-live\">Live and let live</h2>\n<p>One of the main philosophies that Kluctl follows is <a href=\"https://kluctl.io/docs/philosophy/#live-and-let-live\">&quot;live and let live&quot;</a>,\nmeaning that it will try its best to work in conjunction with any other tool or\ncontroller running outside or inside your clusters. Kluctl will not overwrite\nany fields that it lost ownership of, unless you explicitly tell it to do so.</p>\n<p>Achieving this would not have been possible (or at least several magnitudes\nharder) without the use of SSA. Server-side apply allows Kluctl\nto detect when ownership for a field got lost, for example when another controller\nor operator updates that field to another value. Kluctl can then decide on a\nfield-by-field basis if force-applying is required before retrying based on these\ndecisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-days-before-ssa\">The days before SSA</h2>\n<p>The first versions of Kluctl were based on shelling out to <code>kubectl</code> and thus\nimplicitly relied on client-side apply. At that time, SSA was\nstill alpha and quite buggy. And to be honest, I didn't even know it was a\nthing at that time.</p>\n<p>The way client-side apply worked had some serious drawbacks. The most obvious one\n(it was guaranteed that you'd stumble on this by yourself if enough time passed)\nis that it relied on an annotation (<code>kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration</code>)\nbeing added to the object, bringing in all the limitations and issues with huge\nannotation values. A good example of such issues are\n<a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/issues/4439\">CRDs being so large</a>,\nthat they don't fit into the annotation's value anymore.</p>\n<p>Another drawback can be seen just by looking at the name (<strong>client</strong>-side apply).\nBeing <strong>client</strong> side means that each client has to provide the apply-logic on\nits own, which at that time was only properly implemented inside <code>kubectl</code>,\nmaking it hard to be replicated inside controllers.</p>\n<p>This added <code>kubectl</code> as a dependency (either as an executable or in the form of\nGo packages) to all controllers that wanted to leverage the apply-logic.</p>\n<p>However, even if one managed to get client-side apply running from inside a\ncontroller, you ended up with a solution that gave no control over how it\nworked internally. As an example, there was no way to individually decide which\nfields to overwrite in case of external changes and which ones to let go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discovering-ssa-apply\">Discovering SSA apply</h2>\n<p>I was never happy with the solution described above and then somehow stumbled\nacross <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/\">server-side apply</a>,\nwhich was still in beta at that time. Experimenting with it via\n<code>kubectl apply --server-side</code> revealed immediately that the true power of\nSSA can not be easily leveraged by shelling out to <code>kubectl</code>.</p>\n<p>The way SSA is implemented in <code>kubectl</code> does not allow enough\ncontrol over conflict resolution as it can only switch between\n&quot;not force-applying anything and erroring out&quot; and &quot;force-applying everything\nwithout showing any mercy!&quot;.</p>\n<p>The API documentation however made it clear that SSA is able to\ncontrol conflict resolution on field level, simply by choosing which fields\nto include and which fields to omit from the supplied object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-away-from-kubectl\">Moving away from kubectl</h2>\n<p>This meant that Kluctl had to move away from shelling out to <code>kubectl</code> first. Only\nafter that was done, I would have been able to properly implement SSA\nwith its powerful conflict resolution.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, I first implemented access to the target clusters via a\nKubernetes client library. This had the nice side effect of dramatically\nspeeding up Kluctl as well. It also improved the security and usability of\nKluctl by ensuring that a running Kluctl command could not be messed around\nwith by externally modifying the kubeconfig while it was running.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementing-ssa\">Implementing SSA</h2>\n<p>After switching to a Kubernetes client library, leveraging SSA\nfelt easy. Kluctl now has to send each manifest to the API server as part of a\n<code>PATCH</code> request, which signals\nthat Kluctl wants to perform a SSA operation. The API server then\nresponds with an OK response (HTTP status code 200), or with a Conflict response\n(HTTP status 409).</p>\n<p>In case of a Conflict response, the body of that response includes machine-readable\ndetails about the conflicts. Kluctl can then use these details to figure out\nwhich fields are in conflict and which actors (field managers) have taken\nownership of the conflicted fields.</p>\n<p>Then, for each field, Kluctl will decide if the conflict should be ignored or\nif it should be force-applied. If any field needs to be force-applied, Kluctl\nwill retry the apply operation with the ignored fields omitted and the <code>force</code>\nflag being set on the API call.</p>\n<p>In case a conflict is ignored, Kluctl will issue a warning to the user so that\nthe user can react properly (or ignore it forever...).</p>\n<p>That's basically it. That is all that is required to leverage SSA.\nBig thanks and thumbs-up to the Kubernetes developers who made this possible!</p>\n<h2 id=\"conflict-resolution\">Conflict Resolution</h2>\n<p>Kluctl has a few simple rules to figure out if a conflict should be ignored\nor force-applied.</p>\n<p>It first checks the field's actor (the field manager) against a list of known\nfield manager strings from tools that are frequently used to perform manual modifications. These\nare for example <code>kubectl</code> and <code>k9s</code>. Any modifications performed with these tools\nare considered &quot;temporary&quot; and will be overwritten by Kluctl.</p>\n<p>If you're using Kluctl along with <code>kubectl</code> where you don't want the changes from\n<code>kubectl</code> to be overwritten (for example, using in a script) then you can specify\n<code>--field-manager=&lt;manager-name&gt;</code> on the command line to <code>kubectl</code>, and Kluctl\ndoesn't apply its special heuristic.</p>\n<p>If the field manager is not known by Kluctl, it will check if force-applying is\nrequested for that field. Force-applying can be requested in different ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By passing <code>--force-apply</code> to Kluctl. This will cause ALL fields to be force-applied on conflicts.</li>\n<li>By adding the <a href=\"https://kluctl.io/docs/reference/deployments/annotations/all-resources/#kluctlioforce-apply\"><code>kluctl.io/force-apply=true</code></a> annotation to the object in question. This will cause all fields of that object to be force-applied on conflicts.</li>\n<li>By adding the <a href=\"https://kluctl.io/docs/reference/deployments/annotations/all-resources/#kluctlioforce-apply-field\"><code>kluctl.io/force-apply-field=my.json.path</code></a> annotation to the object in question. This causes only fields matching the JSON path to be force-applied on conflicts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Marking a field to be force-applied is required whenever some other actor is\nknown to erroneously claim fields (the ECK operator does this to the nodeSets\nfield for example), you can ensure that Kluctl always overwrites these fields\nto the original or a new value.</p>\n<p>In the future, Kluctl will allow even more control about conflict resolution.\nFor example, the CLI will allow to control force-applying on field level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"devops-vs-controllers\">DevOps vs Controllers</h2>\n<p>So how does SSA in Kluctl lead to &quot;live and let live&quot;?</p>\n<p>It allows the co-existence of classical pipelines (e.g. Github Actions or\nGitlab CI), controllers (e.g. the HPA controller or GitOps style controllers)\nand even admins running deployments from their local machines.</p>\n<p>Wherever you are on your infrastructure automation journey, Kluctl has a place\nfor you. From running deployments using a script on your PC, all the way to\nfully automated CI/CD with the pipelines themselves defined in code, Kluctl\naims to complement the workflow that's right for you.</p>\n<p>And even after fully automating everything, you can intervene with your admin\npermissions if required and run a <code>kubectl</code> command that will modify a field\nand prevent Kluctl from overwriting it. You'd just have to switch to a\nfield-manager (e.g. &quot;admin-override&quot;) that is not overwritten by Kluctl.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-few-takeaways\">A few takeaways</h2>\n<p>Server-side apply is a great feature and essential for the future of\ncontrollers and tools in Kubernetes. The amount of controllers involved\nwill only get more and proper modes of working together are a must.</p>\n<p>I believe that CI/CD-related controllers and tools should leverage\nSSA to perform proper conflict resolution. I also believe that\nother controllers (e.g. Flux and ArgoCD) would benefit from the same kind\nof conflict resolution control on field-level.</p>\n<p>It might even be a good idea to come together and work on a standardized\nset of annotations to control conflict resolution for CI/CD-related tooling.</p>\n<p>On the other side, non CI/CD-related controllers should ensure that they don't\ncause unnecessary conflicts when modifying objects. As of\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/#using-server-side-apply-in-a-controller\">the server-side apply documentation</a>,\nit is strongly recommended for controllers to always perform force-applying. When\nfollowing this recommendation, controllers should really make sure that only\nfields related to the controller are included in the applied object.\nOtherwise, unnecessary conflicts are guaranteed.</p>\n<p>In many cases, controllers are meant to only modify the status subresource\nof the objects they manage. In this case, controllers should only patch the\nstatus subresource and not touch the actual object. If this is followed,\nconflicts become impossible to occur.</p>\n<p>If you are a developer of such a controller and unsure about your controller\nadhering to the above, simply try to retrieve an object managed by your\ncontroller and look at the <code>managedFields</code> (you'll need to pass\n<code>--show-managed-fields -oyaml</code> to <code>kubectl get</code>) to see if some field got\nclaimed unexpectedly.</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-11-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/11/04/live-and-let-live-with-kluctl-and-ssa/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":2139,"Title":"Explore-exploit dilemma in Ranking model","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-11-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://tech.trivago.com/post/2022-11-04-explore-exploit-dilemma-in-ranking-model/","SourceName":"Trivago"}},{"node":{"ID":2144,"Title":"Apache Kafka Overview","Description":"What Is Apache Kafka?

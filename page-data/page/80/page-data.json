It’s the modern embodiment of the principle of computing resource <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing\">time-sharing</a> pioneered by John McCarthy and later by UNIX, which evolved into the underpinnings of much of modern-day cloud computing. Because Common Runtime resources are safely shared between customers, we can offer dynos very efficiently, participate in the <a href=\"https://blog.heroku.com/github-student-developer-program\">GitHub Student Program</a>, and run the <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/open-source-credit-program\">Heroku Open Source Credit Program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We previously allowed individual dynos to burst their CPU use relatively freely as long as capacity was available. This is in the spirit of time-sharing and improves overall resource utilization by allowing some dynos to burst while others are dormant or waiting on I/O.</p>\n\n<p>Liberal bursting has worked well over the years and most customers got excellent CPU performance at a fair price. Some customers using shared dynos occasionally reported degraded performance, however, typically due to “noisy neighbors”: other dynos on the same instance that, because of misconfiguration or malice, used much more than their fair share of the shared resources. This would manifest as random spikes in request response times or even <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/addressing-h12-errors-request-timeouts\">H12 timeouts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To help address the problem of noisy neighbors, over the past year Heroku has quietly rolled out improved resource isolation for shared dyno types to ensure more stable and predictable access to CPU resources. Dynos can still burst CPU use, but not as much as before. While less flexible, this will mean fairer and more predictable access to the shared resources backing <code>eco</code>, <code>basic</code>, <code>standard-1X</code>, and <code>standard-2X</code> Dynos. We’re not changing how many dynos run on each instance, we’re only ensuring more predictable and fair access to resources. Also note that Performance, Private, and Shield type Dynos are not affected because they run on dedicated instances.</p>\n\n<p><i>Want to see what we’re working on next or suggest improvements for Heroku?

The Kubernetes project created and runs the <code>registry.k8s.io</code> image registry, which is fully controlled by the community.\nThis means that the old registry <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related sub-projects will be published to the old registry.</p>\n<p>What does this change mean for contributors?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are a maintainer of a sub-project, you will need to update your manifests and Helm charts to use the new registry.

This value is overridable in kubeadm and kubelet but setting it to <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> will fail for new releases after April as they won’t be present in the old registry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you want to increase the reliability of your cluster and remove dependency on the community-owned registry or you are running Kubernetes in networks where external traffic is restricted, you should consider hosting local image registry mirrors. Some cloud vendors may offer hosted solutions for this.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"seccompdefault-graduates-to-stable\"><code>SeccompDefault</code> graduates to stable</h2>\n<p>To use seccomp profile defaulting, you must run the kubelet with the <code>--seccomp-default</code> <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet\">command line flag</a> enabled for each node where you want to use it.\nIf enabled, the kubelet will use the <code>RuntimeDefault</code> seccomp profile by default, which is defined by the container runtime, instead of using the <code>Unconfined</code> (seccomp disabled) mode. The default profiles aim to provide a strong set of security defaults while preserving the functionality of the workload. It is possible that the default profiles differ between container runtimes and their release versions.</p>\n<p>You can find detailed information about a possible upgrade and downgrade strategy in the related Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP): <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2413-seccomp-by-default\">Enable seccomp by default</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mutable-scheduling-directives-for-jobs-graduates-to-ga\">Mutable scheduling directives for Jobs graduates to GA</h2>\n<p>This was introduced in v1.22 and started as a beta level, now it's stable. In most cases a parallel job will want the pods to run with constraints, like all in the same zone, or all either on GPU model x or y but not a mix of both. The <code>suspend</code> field is the first step towards achieving those semantics. <code>suspend</code> allows a custom queue controller to decide when a job should start. However, once a job is unsuspended, a custom queue controller has no influence on where the pods of a job will actually land.</p>\n<p>This feature allows updating a Job's scheduling directives before it starts, which gives custom queue controllers\nthe ability to influence pod placement while at the same time offloading actual pod-to-node assignment to\nkube-scheduler. This is allowed only for suspended Jobs that have never been unsuspended before.\nThe fields in a Job's pod template that can be updated are node affinity, node selector, tolerations, labels\n,annotations, and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/\">scheduling gates</a>.\nFind more details in the KEP:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-scheduling/2926-job-mutable-scheduling-directives\">Allow updating scheduling directives of jobs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downwardapihugepages-graduates-to-stable\">DownwardAPIHugePages graduates to stable</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.20, support for <code>requests.hugepages-&lt;pagesize&gt;</code> and <code>limits.hugepages-&lt;pagesize&gt;</code> was added\nto the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/\">downward API</a> to be consistent with other resources like cpu, memory, and ephemeral storage.\nThis feature graduates to stable in this release. You can find more details in the KEP:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2053-downward-api-hugepages\">Downward API HugePages</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pod-scheduling-readiness-goes-to-beta\">Pod Scheduling Readiness goes to beta</h2>\n<p>Upon creation, Pods are ready for scheduling. Kubernetes scheduler does its due diligence to find nodes to place all pending Pods. However, in a real-world case, some Pods may stay in a <em>missing-essential-resources</em> state for a long period. These Pods actually churn the scheduler (and downstream integrators like Cluster Autoscaler) in an unnecessary manner.</p>\n<p>By specifying/removing a Pod's <code>.spec.schedulingGates</code>, you can control when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.</p>\n<p>The <code>schedulingGates</code> field contains a list of strings, and each string literal is perceived as a criteria that must be satisfied before a Pod is considered schedulable. This field can be initialized only when a Pod is created (either by the client, or mutated during admission). After creation, each schedulingGate can be removed in an arbitrary order, but addition of a new scheduling gate is disallowed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"node-log-access-via-kubernetes-api\">Node log access via Kubernetes API</h2>\n<p>This feature helps cluster administrators debug issues with services running on nodes by allowing them to query service logs. To use this feature, ensure that the <code>NodeLogQuery</code> <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> is enabled on that node, and that the kubelet configuration options <code>enableSystemLogHandler</code> and <code>enableSystemLogQuery</code> are both set to true.\nOn Linux, we assume that service logs are available via journald. On Windows, we assume that service logs are available in the application log provider. You can also fetch logs from the <code>/var/log/</code> and <code>C:\\var\\log</code> directories on Linux and Windows, respectively.</p>\n<p>A cluster administrator can try out this alpha feature across all nodes of their cluster, or on a subset of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"readwriteoncepod-persistentvolume-access-mode-goes-to-beta\">ReadWriteOncePod PersistentVolume access mode goes to beta</h2>\n<p>Kuberentes <code>v1.22</code> introduced a new access mode <code>ReadWriteOncePod</code> for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes\">PersistentVolumes</a> (PVs) and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims\">PersistentVolumeClaims</a> (PVCs). This access mode enables you to restrict volume access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads that require single-writer access to storage.</p>\n<p>The ReadWriteOncePod beta adds support for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/\">scheduler preemption</a>\nof pods that use ReadWriteOncePod PVCs.\nScheduler preemption allows higher-priority pods to preempt lower-priority pods. For example when a pod (A) with a <code>ReadWriteOncePod</code> PVC is scheduled, if another pod (B) is found using the same PVC and pod (A) has higher priority, the scheduler will return an <code>Unschedulable</code> status and attempt to preempt pod (B).\nFor more context, see the KEP: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/2485-read-write-once-pod-pv-access-mode\">ReadWriteOncePod PersistentVolume AccessMode</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"respect-podtopologyspread-after-rolling-upgrades\">Respect PodTopologySpread after rolling upgrades</h2>\n<p><code>matchLabelKeys</code> is a list of pod label keys used to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the pod labels. Those key-value labels are ANDed with <code>labelSelector</code> to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. Keys that don't exist in the pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against the <code>labelSelector</code>.</p>\n<p>With <code>matchLabelKeys</code>, users don't need to update the <code>pod.spec</code> between different revisions. The controller/operator just needs to set different values to the same <code>label</code> key for different revisions. The scheduler will assume the values automatically based on <code>matchLabelKeys</code>. For example, if users use Deployment, they can use the label keyed with <code>pod-template-hash</code>, which is added automatically by the Deployment controller, to distinguish between different revisions in a single Deployment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faster-selinux-volume-relabeling-using-mounts\">Faster SELinux volume relabeling using mounts</h2>\n<p>In this release, how SELinux labels are applied to volumes used by Pods is graduating to beta. This feature speeds up container startup by mounting volumes with the correct SELinux label instead of changing each file on the volumes recursively. Linux kernel with SELinux support allows the first mount of a volume to set SELinux label on the whole volume using <code>-o context=</code> mount option. This way, all files will have assigned the given label in a constant time, without recursively walking through the whole volumes.</p>\n<p>The <code>context</code> mount option cannot be applied to bind mounts or re-mounts of already mounted volumes.\nFor CSI storage, a CSI driver does the first mount of a volume, and so it must be the CSI driver that actually\napplies this mount option. We added a new field <code>SELinuxMount</code> to CSIDriver objects, so that drivers can\nannounce whether they support the <code>-o context</code> mount option.</p>\n<p>If Kubernetes knows the SELinux label of a Pod <strong>and</strong> the CSI driver responsible for a pod's volume\nannounces <code>SELinuxMount: true</code> <strong>and</strong> the volume has Access Mode <code>ReadWriteOncePod</code>, then it\nwill ask the CSI driver to mount the volume with mount option <code>context=</code> <strong>and</strong> it will tell the container\nruntime not to relabel content of the volume (because all files already have the right label).\nGet more information on this from the KEP: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/1710-selinux-relabeling\">Speed up SELinux volume relabeling using mounts</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"robust-volumemanager-reconstruction-goes-to-beta\">Robust VolumeManager reconstruction goes to beta</h2>\n<p>This is a volume manager refactoring that allows the kubelet to populate additional information about how\nexisting volumes are mounted during the kubelet startup. In general, this makes volume cleanup more robust.\nIf you enable the <code>NewVolumeManagerReconstruction</code> feature gate on a node, you'll get enhanced discovery of mounted volumes during kubelet startup.</p>\n<p>Before Kubernetes v1.25, the kubelet used different default behavior for discovering mounted volumes during the kubelet startup. If you disable this feature gate (it's enabled by default), you select the legacy discovery behavior.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.25 and v1.26, this behavior toggle was part of the <code>SELinuxMountReadWriteOncePod</code> feature gate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mutable-pod-scheduling-directives-goes-to-beta\">Mutable Pod Scheduling Directives goes to beta</h2>\n<p>This allows mutating a pod that is blocked on a scheduling readiness gate with a more constrained node affinity/selector. It gives the ability to mutate a pods scheduling directives before it is allowed to be scheduled and gives an external resource controller the ability to influence pod placement while at the same time offload actual pod-to-node assignment to kube-scheduler.</p>\n<p>This opens the door for a new pattern of adding scheduling features to Kubernetes. Specifically, building lightweight schedulers that implement features not supported by kube-scheduler, while relying on the existing kube-scheduler to support all upstream features and handle the pod-to-node binding. This pattern should be the preferred one if the custom feature doesn't require implementing a schedule plugin, which entails re-building and maintaining a custom kube-scheduler binary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feature-graduations-and-deprecations-in-kubernetes-v1-27\">Feature graduations and deprecations in Kubernetes v1.27</h2>\n<h3 id=\"graduations-to-stable\">Graduations to stable</h3>\n<p>This release includes a total of 9 enhancements promoted to Stable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2227\">Default container annotation that to be used by kubectl</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3140\">TimeZone support in CronJob</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1748\">Expose metrics about resource requests and limits that represent the pod model</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2885\">Server Side Unknown Field Validation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/693\">Node Topology Manager</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2727\">Add gRPC probe to Pod.Spec.Container.{Liveness,Readiness,Startup} Probe</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2238\">Add configurable grace period to probes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2896\">OpenAPI v3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3744\">Stay on supported Go versions</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"deprecations-and-removals\">Deprecations and removals</h3>\n<p>This release saw several removals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108445\">Removal of <code>storage.k8s.io/v1beta1</code> from CSIStorageCapacity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/114947\">Removal of support for deprecated seccomp annotations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112797\">Removal of <code>--master-service-namespace</code> command line argument</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113534\">Removal of the <code>ControllerManagerLeaderMigration</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111411\">Removal of <code>--enable-taint-manager</code> command line argument</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113710\">Removal of <code>--pod-eviction-timeout</code> command line argument</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110410\">Removal of the <code>CSI Migration</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111258\">Removal of <code>CSIInlineVolume</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111402\">Removal of <code>EphemeralContainers</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111513\">Removal of <code>LocalStorageCapacityIsolation</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110868\">Removal of <code>NetworkPolicyEndPort</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110896\">Removal of <code>StatefulSetMinReadySeconds</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111229\">Removal of <code>IdentifyPodOS</code> feature gate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111194\">Removal of <code>DaemonSetUpdateSurge</code> feature gate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"release-notes\">Release notes</h2>\n<p>The complete details of the Kubernetes v1.27 release are available in our <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md\">release notes</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"availability\">Availability</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.27 is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.27.0\">GitHub</a>.

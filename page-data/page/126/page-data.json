So I’d like to write down some of those reasons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits\">Obvious (and not-so-obvious) benefits of SSA</h2>\n<p>A list of improvements / niceties you get from switching from various things to\nServer-side apply!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Versus client-side-apply (that is, plain <code>kubectl apply</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>The system gives you conflicts when you accidentally fight with another\nactor over the value of a field!</li>\n<li>When combined with <code>--dry-run</code>, there’s no chance of accidentally running a\nclient-side dry run instead of a server side dry run.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Versus hand-rolling patches:\n<ul>\n<li>The SSA patch format is extremely natural to write, with no weird syntax.\nIt’s just a regular object, but you can (and should) omit any field you\ndon’t care about.</li>\n<li>The old patch format (“strategic merge patch”) was ad-hoc and still has some\nbugs; JSON-patch and JSON merge-patch fail to handle some cases that are\ncommon in the Kubernetes API, namely lists with items that should be\nrecursively merged based on a “name” or other identifying field.</li>\n<li>There’s also now great <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/06/server-side-apply-ga/#using-server-side-apply-in-a-controller\">go-language library support</a>\nfor building apply calls programmatically!</li>\n<li>You can use SSA to explicitly delete fields you don’t “own” by setting them\nto <code>null</code>, which makes it a feature-complete replacement for all of the old\npatch formats.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Versus shelling out to kubectl:\n<ul>\n<li>You can use the <strong>apply</strong> API call from any language without shelling out to\nkubectl!</li>\n<li>As stated above, the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/06/server-side-apply-ga/#server-side-apply-support-in-client-go\">Go library has dedicated mechanisms</a>\nto make this easy now.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Versus GET-modify-PUT:\n<ul>\n<li>(This one is more complicated and you can skip it if you've never written a\ncontroller!)</li>\n<li>To use GET-modify-PUT correctly, you have to handle and retry a write\nfailure in the case that someone else has modified the object in any way\nbetween your GET and PUT. This is an “optimistic concurrency failure” when\nit happens.</li>\n<li>SSA offloads this task to the server– you only have to retry if there’s a\nconflict, and the conflicts you can get are all meaningful, like when you’re\nactually trying to take a field away from another actor in the system.</li>\n<li>To put it another way, if 10 actors do a GET-modify-PUT cycle at the same\ntime, 9 will get an optimistic concurrency failure and have to retry, then\n8, etc, for up to 50 total GET-PUT attempts in the worst case (that’s .5N^2\nGET and PUT calls for N actors making simultaneous changes). If the actors\nare using SSA instead, and the changes don’t actually conflict over specific\nfields, then all the changes can go in in any order. Additionally, SSA\nchanges can often be done without a GET call at all. That’s only N <strong>apply</strong>\nrequests for N actors, which is a drastic improvement!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-i-use-ssa\">How can I use SSA?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"users\">Users</h3>\n<p>Use <code>kubectl apply --server-side</code>! Soon we (SIG API Machinery) hope to make this\nthe default and remove the “client side” apply completely!</p>\n<h3 id=\"controller-authors\">Controller authors</h3>\n<p>There’s two main categories here, but for both of them, <strong>you should probably\n<em>force conflicts</em> when using SSA</strong>. This is because your controller probably\ndoesn’t know what to do when some other entity in the system has a different\ndesire than your controller about a particular field. (See the <a href=\"#ci-cd-systems\">CI/CD\nsection</a>, though!)</p>\n<h4 id=\"get-modify-put-patch-controllers\">Controllers that use either a GET-modify-PUT sequence or a PATCH</h4>\n<p>This kind of controller GETs an object (possibly from a\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#efficient-detection-of-changes\"><strong>watch</strong></a>),\nmodifies it, and then PUTs it back to write its changes. Sometimes it constructs\na custom PATCH, but the semantics are the same. Most existing controllers\n(especially those in-tree) work like this.</p>\n<p>If your controller is perfect, great! You don’t need to change it. But if you do\nwant to change it, you can take advantage of the new client library’s <em>extract</em>\nworkflow– that is, <strong>get</strong> the existing object, extract your existing desires,\nmake modifications, and re-<strong>apply</strong>. For many controllers that were computing\nthe smallest API changes possible, this will be a minor update to the existing\nimplementation.</p>\n<p>This workflow avoids the failure mode of accidentally trying to own every field\nin the object, which is what happens if you just GET the object, make changes,\nand then <strong>apply</strong>. (Note that the server will notice you did this and reject\nyour change!)</p>\n<h4 id=\"reconstructive-controllers\">Reconstructive controllers</h4>\n<p>This kind of controller wasn't really possible prior to SSA. The idea here is to\n(whenever something changes etc) reconstruct from scratch the fields of the\nobject as the controller wishes them to be, and then <strong>apply</strong> the change to the\nserver, letting it figure out the result. I now recommend that new controllers\nstart out this way–it's less fiddly to say what you want an object to look like\nthan it is to say how you want it to change.</p>\n<p>The client library supports this method of operation by default.</p>\n<p>The only downside is that you may end up sending unneeded <strong>apply</strong> requests to\nthe API server, even if actually the object already matches your controller’s\ndesires. This doesn't matter if it happens once in a while, but for extremely\nhigh-throughput controllers, it might cause a performance problem for the\ncluster–specifically, the API server. No-op writes are not written to storage\n(etcd) or broadcast to any watchers, so it’s not really that big of a deal. If\nyou’re worried about this anyway, today you could use the method explained in\nthe previous section, or you could still do it this way for now, and wait for an\nadditional client-side mechanism to suppress zero-change applies.</p>\n<p>To get around this downside, why not GET the object and only send your <strong>apply</strong>\nif the object needs it? Surprisingly, it doesn't help much – a no-op <strong>apply</strong> is\nnot very much more work for the API server than an extra GET; and an <strong>apply</strong>\nthat changes things is cheaper than that same <strong>apply</strong> with a preceding GET.\nWorse, since it is a distributed system, something could change between your GET\nand <strong>apply</strong>, invalidating your computation. Instead, you can use this\noptimization on an object retrieved from a cache–then it legitimately will\nreduce load on the system (at the cost of a delay when a change is needed and\nthe cache is a bit behind).</p>\n<h4 id=\"ci-cd-systems\">CI/CD systems</h4>\n<p>Continuous integration (CI) and/or continuous deployment (CD) systems are a\nspecial kind of controller which is doing something like reading manifests from\nsource control (such as a Git repo) and automatically pushing them into the\ncluster. Perhaps the CI / CD process first generates manifests from a template,\nthen runs some tests, and then deploys a change. Typically, users are the\nentities pushing changes into source control, although that’s not necessarily\nalways the case.</p>\n<p>Some systems like this continuously reconcile with the cluster, others may only\noperate when a change is pushed to the source control system. The following\nconsiderations are important for both, but more so for the continuously\nreconciling kind.</p>\n<p>CI/CD systems are literally controllers, but for the purpose of <strong>apply</strong>, they\nare more like users, and unlike other controllers, they need to pay attention to\nconflicts. Reasoning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstractly, CI/CD systems can change anything, which means they could conflict\nwith <strong>any</strong> controller out there. The recommendation that controllers force\nconflicts is assuming that controllers change a limited number of things and\nyou can be reasonably sure that they won’t fight with other controllers about\nthose things; that’s clearly not the case for CI/CD controllers.</li>\n<li>Concrete example: imagine the CI/CD system wants <code>.spec.replicas</code> for some\nDeployment to be 3, because that is the value that is checked into source\ncode; however there is also a HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) that targets the\nsame deployment. The HPA computes a target scale and decides that there should\nbe 10 replicas. Which should win? I just said that most controllers–including\nthe HPA–should ignore conflicts. The HPA has no idea if it has been enabled\nincorrectly, and the HPA has no convenient way of informing users of errors.</li>\n<li>The other common cause of a CI/CD system getting a conflict is probably when\nit is trying to overwrite a hot-fix (hand-rolled patch) placed there by a\nsystem admin / SRE / dev-on-call. You almost certainly don’t want to override\nthat automatically.</li>\n<li>Of course, sometimes SRE makes an accidental change, or a dev makes an\nunauthorized change – those you do want to notice and overwrite; however, the\nCI/CD system can’t tell the difference between these last two cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully this convinces you that CI/CD systems need error paths–a way to\nback-propagate these conflict errors to humans; in fact, they should have this\nalready, certainly continuous integration systems need some way to report that\ntests are failing. But maybe I can also say something about how <em>humans</em> can\ndeal with errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reject the hotfix: the (human) administrator of the CI/CD system observes the\nerror, and manually force-applies the manifest in question. Then the CI/CD\nsystem will be able to apply the manifest successfully and become a co-owner.</p>\n<p>Optional: then the administrator applies a blank manifest (just the object\ntype / namespace / name) to relinquish any fields they became a manager for.\nif this step is omitted, there's some chance the administrator will end up\nowning fields and causing an unwanted future conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: why an administrator? I'm assuming that developers which ordinarily\npush to the CI/CD system and / or its source control system may not have\npermissions to push directly to the cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accept the hotfix: the author of the change in question sees the conflict, and\nedits their change to accept the value running in production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accept then reject: as in the accept option, but after that manifest is\napplied, and the CI/CD queue owns everything again (so no conflicts), re-apply\nthe original manifest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I can also imagine the CI/CD system permitting you to mark a manifest as\n“force conflicts” somehow– if there’s demand for this we could consider making\na more standardized way to do this. A rigorous version of this which lets you\ndeclare exactly which conflicts you intend to force would require support from\nthe API server; in lieu of that, you can make a second manifest with only that\nsubset of fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Future work: we could imagine an especially advanced CI/CD system that could\nparse <code>metadata.managedFields</code> data to see who or what they are conflicting\nwith, over what fields, and decide whether or not to ignore the conflict. In\nfact, this information is also presented in any conflict errors, though\nperhaps not in an easily machine-parseable format. We (SIG API Machinery)\nmostly didn't expect that people would want to take this approach — so we\nwould love to know if in fact people want/need the features implied by this\napproach, such as the ability, when <strong>apply</strong>ing to request to override\ncertain conflicts but not others.</p>\n<p>If this sounds like an approach you'd want to take for your own controller,\ncome talk to SIG API Machinery!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happy <strong>apply</strong>ing!</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/10/20/advanced-server-side-apply/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":2019,"Title":"How CIOs can support business resilience in uncertain times","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-cios-can-support-business-resilience-in-uncertain-times","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2021,"Title":"Why observability can break through top challenges to digital transformation","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-10-20 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-observability-can-break-through-top-challenges-to-digital-transformation","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2007,"Title":"HashiCorp Wins Datadog’s Integration Developer Partner of the Year Award","Description":"HashiCorp has won the 2022 Datadog Partner Network (DPN) Integration Developer Partner of the Year Award.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 19:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-wins-datadog-s-integration-developer-partner-of-the-year-award","SourceName":"HashiCorp"}},{"node":{"ID":2006,"Title":"Making peering easy with the new Cloudflare Peering Portal","Description":"Cloudflare's peering portal allows users to log in with existing PeeringDB credentials and request peering sessions with cloudflare direct from the portal","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 18:26:25+00:00","OriginURL":"https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-peering-easy-with-the-new-cloudflare-peering-portal/","SourceName":"Cloudflare"}},{"node":{"ID":1985,"Title":"New Competency Program Validates Systems Integrators’ HashiCorp Expertise","Description":"The new Technical Competency Program for Systems Integrators allows partners to display earned competency badges on both their own website and HashiCorp.com.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 16:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/new-competency-program-validates-systems-integrators-hashicorp-expertise","SourceName":"HashiCorp"}},{"node":{"ID":2001,"Title":"Datadog Announces PCI Compliance for Log Management and APM","Description":"NEW YORK — Datadog, Inc.

Without proactive measures, you may unintentionally expose this sensitive data, violating the privacy of your customers, your organizational policies, compliance requirements, or industry regulations.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/identify-sensitive-data-leakage-in-apm-rum-with-sensitive-data-scanner/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1995,"Title":"Leverage collaborative screen sharing with Datadog CoScreen","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/collaborative-screen-sharing-with-datadog-coscreen/coscreen-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Remote collaboration tools have transformed how remote and hybrid teams work synchronously. But while the current popular chat forum and video conferencing solutions are inarguably helpful, few were created with software development and operations in mind. CoScreen is the only real-time collaboration tool designed specifically for remote and hybrid engineering teams that integrate both interactive screen sharing and video conferencing features. By enabling engineering and product teams to seamlessly share and interact with each other’s application windows simultaneously, CoScreen meetings offer a productive environment for remote pair programming, technical onboarding, incident response, and more.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/collaborative-screen-sharing-with-datadog-coscreen/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1996,"Title":"Streamline your CI testing with Datadog Intelligent Test Runner","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/streamline-ci-testing-with-datadog-intelligent-test-runner/itr_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Modern continuous integration (CI) practices enable development teams to quickly and efficiently build and deploy application code to a shared codebase. However, deploying new code is typically accompanied by tests, and as the codebase expands, this results in a proportionately larger test suite. When an entire test suite needs to run in order to validate each small code change, testing can feel more like a chore rather than an integral part of the development process, creating a cumbersome feedback cycle for developers.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/streamline-ci-testing-with-datadog-intelligent-test-runner/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1997,"Title":"Use Datadog Continuous Testing to release with confidence","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/release-confidently-with-datadog-continuous-testing/continuous_testing_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Testing early and often in the development cycle is a must for ensuring that your application meets user expectations. Poor performance and errors can alienate users and prevent you from meeting crucial benchmarks and OKRs. Additionally, having to constantly implement fixes after new, under-tested features are added can fatigue developers and strain your resources, making your organization less nimble overall. By integrating testing at every stage of the application development process, you can catch critical issues before release and help ensure the best possible user experience on every device and browser.","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/release-confidently-with-datadog-continuous-testing/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":2005,"Title":"HIPAA-Eligible Services","Description":"As of the date displayed above, the following Datadog Services are included as &ldquo;Eligible Services&rdquo; under the applicable Datadog Business Associate Agreement.Cloud SIEM (formerly Security Monitoring) Log Management As of the date displayed above, the following Datadog Services are included as “Extended Eligible Services” under the applicable Datadog Business Associate Agreement.Application Performance Monitoring Audit Trail CI Visibility Cloud Security Posture Management Cloud SIEM Cloud Workload Security Continuous Profiler Database Monitoring Incident Management Infrastructure Monitoring Log Management Network Device Monitoring Network Performance Monitoring Real User Monitoring Sensitive Data Scanner Serverless Monitoring Session Replay Synthetic Monitoring","PublishedAt":"2022-10-19 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/legal/hipaa-eligible-services/2022-10-19/","SourceName":"Datadog"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":30,"skip":3750,"numPages":193,"currentPage":126}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

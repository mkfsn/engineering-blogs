In this edition, we turn\nour attention to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-testing#readme\">SIG Testing</a>,\na group interested in effective testing of Kubernetes and automating\naway project toil. SIG Testing focus on creating and running tools and\ninfrastructure that make it easier for the community to write and run\ntests, and to contribute, analyze and act upon test results.</p>\n<p>To gain some insights into SIG Testing, <a href=\"https://github.com/sandipanpanda\">Sandipan\nPanda</a> spoke with <a href=\"https://github.com/michelle192837\">Michelle Shepardson</a>,\na senior software engineer at Google and a chair of SIG Testing, and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pohly\">Patrick Ohly</a>, a software engineer and architect at\nIntel and a SIG Testing Tech Lead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meet-the-contributors\">Meet the contributors</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and\nhow you got involved in the Kubernetes project and SIG Testing?</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Hi! I'm Michelle, a senior software engineer at\nGoogle. I first got involved in Kubernetes through working on tooling\nfor SIG Testing, like the external instance of TestGrid. I'm part of\noncall for TestGrid and Prow, and am now a chair for the SIG.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Hello! I work as a software engineer and architect in a\nteam at Intel which focuses on open source Cloud Native projects. When\nI ramped up on Kubernetes to develop a storage driver, my very first\nquestion was &quot;how do I test it in a cluster and how do I log\ninformation?&quot; That interest led to various enhancement proposals until\nI had (re)written enough code that also took over official roles as\nSIG Testing Tech Lead (for the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework\">E2E framework</a>) and\nstructured logging WG lead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-practices-and-tools\">Testing practices and tools</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> Testing is a field in which multiple approaches and\ntools exist; how did you arrive at the existing practices?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I canâ€™t speak about the early days because I wasnâ€™t\naround yet ðŸ˜†, but looking back at some of the commit history itâ€™s\npretty obvious that developers just took what was available and\nstarted using it. For E2E testing, that was\n<a href=\"https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo\">Ginkgo+Gomega</a>. Some hacks were\nnecessary, for example around cleanup after a test run and for\ncategorising tests. Eventually this led to Ginkgo v2 and <a href=\"https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2023/04/12/e2e-testing-best-practices-reloaded/\">revised best\npractices for E2E testing</a>.\nRegarding unit testing opinions are pretty diverse: some maintainers\nprefer to use just the Go standard library with hand-written\nchecks. Others use helper packages like stretchr/testify. That\ndiversity is okay because unit tests are self-contained - contributors\njust have to be flexible when working on many different areas.\nIntegration testing falls somewhere in the middle. Itâ€™s based on Go\nunit tests, but needs complex helper packages to bring up an apiserver\nand other components, then runs tests that are more like E2E tests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"subprojects-owned-by-sig-testing\">Subprojects owned by SIG Testing</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> SIG Testing is pretty diverse. Can you give a brief\noverview of the various subprojects owned by SIG Testing?</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Broadly, we have subprojects related to testing\nframeworks, and infrastructure, though they definitely overlap. So\nfor the former, there's\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/e2e-framework\">e2e-framework</a> (used\nexternally),\n<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kubernetes/test/e2e/framework\">test/e2e/framework</a>\n(used for Kubernetes itself) and kubetest2 for end-to-end testing,\nas well as boskos (resource rental for e2e tests),\n<a href=\"https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/\">KIND</a> (Kubernetes-in-Docker, for local\ntesting and development), and the cloud provider for KIND. For the\nlatter, there's <a href=\"https://docs.prow.k8s.io/\">Prow</a> (K8s-based CI/CD and\nchatops), and a litany of other tools and utilities for triage,\nanalysis, coverage, Prow/TestGrid config generation, and more in the\ntest-infra repo.</p>\n<p><em>If you are willing to learn more and get involved with any of the SIG\nTesting subprojects, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-testing#subprojects\">SIG Testing README</a>.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"key-challenges-and-accomplishments\">Key challenges and accomplishments</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> What are some of the key challenges you face?</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Kubernetes is a gigantic project in every aspect, from\ncontributors to code to users and more. Testing and infrastructure\nhave to meet that scale, keeping up with every change from every repo\nunder Kubernetes while facilitating developing, improving, and\nreleasing the project as much as possible, though of course, we're not\nthe only SIG involved in that. I think another other challenge is\nstaffing subprojects. SIG Testing has a number of subprojects that\nhave existed for years, but many of the original maintainers for them\nhave moved on to other areas or no longer have the time to maintain\nthem. We need to grow long-term expertise and owners in those\nsubprojects.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> As Michelle said, the sheer size can be a challenge. Itâ€™s\nnot just the infrastructure, also our processes must scale with the\nnumber of contributors. Itâ€™s good to document best practices, but not\ngood enough: we have many new contributors, which is good, but having\nreviewers explain best practices doesnâ€™t scale - assuming that the\nreviewers even know about them! It also doesnâ€™t help that existing\ncode cannot get updated immediately because there is so much of it, in\nparticular for E2E testing. The initiative to <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/myGiml72IbM/m/QdO5bgQiAQAJ\">apply stricter linting to new or modified code</a>\nwhile accepting that existing code doesnâ€™t pass those same linter\nchecks helps a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> Any SIG accomplishments that you are proud of and would\nlike to highlight?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I am biased because I have been driving this, but I think\nthat the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework\">E2E framework</a> and linting are now in a much better shape than\nthey used to be. We may soon be able to run integration tests with\nrace detection enabled, which is important because we currently only\nhave that for unit tests and those tend to be less complex.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> Testing is always important, but is there anything\nspecific to your work in terms of the Kubernetes release process?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/flaky-tests.md\">test flakes</a>â€¦\nif we have too many of those, development velocity goes down because\nPRs cannot be merged without clean test runs and those become less\nlikely. Developers also lose trust in testing and just &quot;retest&quot; until\nthey have a clean run, without checking whether failures might indeed\nbe related to a regression in their current change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-people-and-the-scope\">The people and the scope</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> What are some of your favourite things about this SIG?</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> The people, of course ðŸ™‚. Aside from that, I like the\nbroad scope SIG Testing has. I feel like even small changes can make a\nbig difference for fellow contributors, and even if my interests\nchange over time, I'll never run out of projects to work on.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I can work on things that make my life and the life of my\nfellow developers better, like the tooling that we have to use every\nday while working on some new feature elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> Are there any funny / cool / TIL anecdotes that you\ncould tell us?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I started working on E2E framework enhancements five\nyears ago, then was less active there for a while. When I came back\nand wanted to test some new enhancement, I asked about how to write\nunit tests for the new code and was pointed to some existing tests\nwhich looked vaguely familiar, as if I had <em>seen</em> them before. I\nlooked at the commit history and found that I had <em>written</em> them! Iâ€™ll\nlet you decide whether that says something about my failing long-term\nmemory or simply is normalâ€¦ Anyway, folks, remember to write good\ncommit messages and comments; someone will need them at some point -\nit might even be yourself!</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-ahead\">Looking ahead</h2>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> What areas and/or subprojects does your SIG need help with?</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> Some subprojects aren't staffed at the moment and could\nuse folks willing to learn more about\nthem. <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/boskos#boskos\">boskos</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubetest2#kubetest2\">kubetest2</a>\nespecially stand out to me, since both are important for testing but\nlack dedicated owners.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> Are there any useful skills that new contributors to SIG\nTesting can bring to the table? What are some things that people can\ndo to help this SIG if they come from a background that isnâ€™t directly\nlinked to programming?</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> I think user empathy, writing clear feedback, and\nrecognizing patterns are really useful. Someone who uses the test\nframework or tooling and can outline pain points with clear examples,\nor who can recognize a wider issue in the project and pull data to\ninform solutions for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sandipan:</strong> Whatâ€™s next for SIG Testing?</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Stricter linting will soon become mandatory for new\ncode. There are several E2E framework sub-packages that could be\nmodernised, if someone wants to take on that work. I also see an\nopportunity to unify some of our helper code for E2E and integration\ntesting, but that needs more thought and discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> I'm looking forward to making some usability\nimprovements for some of our tools and infra, and to supporting more\nlong-term contributions and growth of contributors into long-term\nroles within the SIG. If you're interested, hit us up!</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, SIG Testing has exciting plans in store. You can get in\ntouch with the folks at SIG Testing in their <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-testing\">Slack channel</a> or attend\none of their regular <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-testing#meetings\">bi-weekly meetings on Tuesdays</a>.

So far, it provides two tools:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><code>kwok</code></dt>\n<dd><code>kwok</code> is the cornerstone of this project, responsible for simulating the lifecycle of fake nodes, pods, and other Kubernetes API resources.</dd>\n<dt><code>kwokctl</code></dt>\n<dd><code>kwokctl</code> is a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation and management of clusters, with nodes simulated by <code>kwok</code>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2 id=\"why-use-kwok\">Why use KWOK?</h2>\n<p>KWOK has several advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong>: You can create and delete clusters and nodes almost instantly, without waiting for boot or provisioning.</li>\n<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: KWOK works with any tools or clients that are compliant with Kubernetes APIs, such as kubectl, helm, kui, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Portability</strong>: KWOK has no specific hardware or software requirements. You can run it using pre-built images, once Docker or Nerdctl is installed. Alternatively, binaries are also available for all platforms and can be easily installed.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: You can configure different node types, labels, taints, capacities, conditions, etc., and you can configure different pod behaviors, status, etc. to test different scenarios and edge cases.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong>: You can simulate thousands of nodes on your laptop without significant consumption of CPU or memory resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-use-cases\">What are the use cases?</h2>\n<p>KWOK can be used for various purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Learning</strong>: You can use KWOK to learn about Kubernetes concepts and features without worrying about resource waste or other consequences.</li>\n<li><strong>Development</strong>: You can use KWOK to develop new features or tools for Kubernetes without accessing to a real cluster or requiring other components.</li>\n<li><strong>Testing</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>You can measure how well your application or controller scales with different numbers of nodes and(or) pods.</li>\n<li>You can generate high loads on your cluster by creating many pods or services with different resource requests or limits.</li>\n<li>You can simulate node failures or network partitions by changing node conditions or randomly deleting nodes.</li>\n<li>You can test how your controller interacts with other components or features of Kubernetes by enabling different feature gates or API versions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-limitations\">What are the limitations?</h2>\n<p>KWOK is not intended to replace others completely. It has some limitations that you should be aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: KWOK is not a kubelet and may exhibit different behaviors in areas such as pod lifecycle management, volume mounting, and device plugins. Its primary function is to simulate updates of node and pod status.</li>\n<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: It's important to note that KWOK doesn't accurately reflect the performance or behavior of real nodes under various workloads or environments. Instead, it approximates some behaviors using simple formulas.</li>\n<li><strong>Security</strong>: KWOK does not enforce any security policies or mechanisms on simulated nodes. It assumes that all requests from the kube-apiserver are authorized and valid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>If you are interested in trying out KWOK, please check its <a href=\"https://kwok.sigs.k8s.io/\">documents</a> for more details.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/03/01/introducing-kwok/manage-clusters.svg\"\nalt=\"Animation of a terminal showing kwokctl in use\"/> <figcaption>\n<p>Using kwokctl to manage simulated clusters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting Involved</h2>\n<p>If you're interested in participating in future discussions or development related to KWOK, there are several ways to get involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slack: <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kwok/\">#kwok</a> for general usage discussion, <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/kwok-dev/\">#kwok-dev</a> for development discussion.

Blocking can be caused by inefficient query or database design as well as resource saturation, and can lead to increased latency, errors, and user frustration. Pinpointing root blockers—the underlying problematic queries that set off cascading locks on database resources—is key to troubleshooting and remediating database performance issues. But it also tends to be difficult, especially when it comes to historical analysis.","PublishedAt":"2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/troubleshoot-blocking-queries-with-database-monitoring/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3072,"Title":"ERGs encourage you to come as you are: Meet Women of Elastic","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-ergs-encourage-you-to-come-as-you-are-meet-women-of-elastic","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3073,"Title":"What the public sector can learn from CDM’s data strategy","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-03-01 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/public-sector-cdms-data-strategy","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3065,"Title":"API authentication vulnerability found in Snyk Kubernetes integration (CVE-2023-1065)","Description":"CVE-2023-1065 is a medium severity vulnerability that does not expose the user of the integration to any direct security risk and no user data could be leaked, but it could have resulted in irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk organization — which could in turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues. ","PublishedAt":"2023-02-28 20:20:23+00:00","OriginURL":"https://snyk.io/blog/api-auth-vuln-snyk-kubernetes-cve-2023-1065/","SourceName":"Snyk"}},{"node":{"ID":3087,"Title":"API authentication vulnerability found in Snyk Kubernetes integration (CVE-2023-1065)","Description":"CVE-2023-1065 is a medium severity vulnerability that does not expose the user of the integration to any direct security risk and no user data could be leaked, but it could have resulted in irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk organization — which could in turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues. ","PublishedAt":"2023-02-28 20:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://snyk.io/blog/api-auth-vuln-snyk-kubernetes-cve-2023-1065","SourceName":"Snyk"}},{"node":{"ID":3060,"Title":"How to build a consistent workflow for development and operations teams","Description":"Explore how using GitHub and HashiCorp together enables enterprises to develop and ship to their customers faster and more secure with consistent workflows and actions.","PublishedAt":"2023-02-28 19:00:19+00:00","OriginURL":"https://github.blog/2023-02-28-how-to-build-a-consistent-workflow-for-development-and-operations-teams/","SourceName":"GitHub"}},{"node":{"ID":3059,"Title":"10 things you didn’t know you could do with GitHub Codespaces","Description":"Unlock the full potential of GitHub Codespaces with these 10 tips and tricks!

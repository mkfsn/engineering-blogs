Our engineering leadership was well aware of the problem, and it was highlighted in our company’s quarterly goals and objectives as modularization. Faster build times means more productive developers. More productive developers are happier and can iterate on products more quickly. Modularization is key to decreasing build times, but avoiding work is another important part of the puzzle, and build caching is one way to avoid that work. Gradle, our tool for building Android, has a local file system cache that reuses outputs of previously performed tasks. We have been using the Gradle remote build cache in order to save our developers’ time. It helps us avoid redoing work that other teammates have already done or switching to old branches. However, to get the full benefits of caching, you have to go beyond simply setting it up.","PublishedAt":"2019-08-30 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/gradle-remote-build-cache-misses","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":650,"Title":"Machine Learning and Bathtubs - How Small Visual Changes Improve User Experience","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2019-08-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://tech.trivago.com/post/2019-08-21-spajourneywithimageconcepts/","SourceName":"Trivago"}},{"node":{"ID":276,"Title":"The Brooklyn iOS August Meetup @ GIPHY","Description":"August 20, 2019 GIPHY HQ – New York, NY Join us at GIPHY on Tuesday, August 20th for two exciting talks featuring our very own iOS developer, Chris Maier as well as Mike Sanderson of Tendigi.

Fulfilling a well-defined SLO is the very definition of meeting your users’ expectations. Conversely, a certain level of service errors is OK as long as you stay within the SLO — in other words, if the SLO grants you an error budget. Burning through this error budget too quickly is the ultimate signal that some rectifying action is needed. The faster the budget is burned, the more urgent it is that engineers get involved. This post describes how we implemented this concept at SoundCloud, enabling us to fulfill our SLOs without flooding our engineers on call with an unsustainable amount of pages.","PublishedAt":"2019-06-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/alerting-on-slos","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":281,"Title":"Who is GIPHY Engineering?","Description":"As GIPHY Engineering continues to grow, we thought it was important to take a step back and have a conversation about what it means to be a GIPHY Engineer.

Altogether, this process took up to one week, though there was even one scenario where it almost took one month to roll out a bug fix.

It allows cluster\nadministrators to define the profiles in a predefined custom resource YAML,\nwhich then gets distributed by the SPO into the whole cluster. Modification and\nremoval of the security profiles are managed by the operator in the same way,\nbut that’s a small subset of its capabilities.</p>\n<p>Another core feature of the SPO is being able to stack seccomp profiles. This\nmeans that users can define a <code>baseProfileName</code> in the YAML specification, which\nthen gets automatically resolved by the operator and combines the syscall rules.\nIf a base profile has another <code>baseProfileName</code>, then the operator will\nrecursively resolve the profiles up to a certain depth. A common use case is to\ndefine base profiles for low level container runtimes (like <a href=\"https://github.com/opencontainers/runc\">runc</a> or\n<a href=\"https://github.com/containers/crun\">crun</a>) which then contain syscalls which are required in any case to run\nthe container. Alternatively, application developers can define seccomp base\nprofiles for their standard distribution containers and stack dedicated profiles\nfor the application logic on top. This way developers can focus on maintaining\nseccomp profiles which are way simpler and scoped to the application logic,\nwithout having a need to take the whole infrastructure setup into account.</p>\n<p>But how to maintain those base profiles? For example, the amount of required\nsyscalls for a runtime can change over its release cycle in the same way it can\nchange for the main application. Base profiles have to be available in the same\ncluster, otherwise the main seccomp profile will fail to deploy. This means that\nthey’re tightly coupled to the main application profiles, which acts against the\nmain idea of base profiles. Distributing and managing them as plain files feels\nlike an additional burden to solve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"oci-artifacts-to-the-rescue\">OCI artifacts to the rescue</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator/releases/v0.8.0\">v0.8.0</a> release of the Security Profiles Operator supports\nmanaging base profiles as OCI artifacts! Imagine OCI artifacts as lightweight\ncontainer images, storing files in layers in the same way images do, but without\na process to be executed. Those artifacts can be used to store security profiles\nlike regular container images in compatible registries. This means they can be\nversioned, namespaced and annotated similar to regular container images.</p>\n<p>To see how that works in action, specify a <code>baseProfileName</code> prefixed with\n<code>oci://</code> within a seccomp profile CRD, for example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>security-profiles-operator.x-k8s.io/v1beta1<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>SeccompProfile<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">name</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>test<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">defaultAction</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>SCMP_ACT_ERRNO<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">baseProfileName</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>oci://ghcr.io/security-profiles/runc:v1.1.5<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">syscalls</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>- <span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">action</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>SCMP_ACT_ALLOW<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">names</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>- uname<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The operator will take care of pulling the content by using <a href=\"https://oras.land\">oras</a>, as\nwell as verifying the <a href=\"https://github.com/sigstore/cosign\">sigstore (cosign)</a> signatures of the artifact. If\nthe artifacts are not signed, then the SPO will reject them. The resulting\nprofile <code>test</code> will then contain all base syscalls from the remote <code>runc</code>\nprofile plus the additional allowed <code>uname</code> one. It is also possible to\nreference the base profile by its digest (SHA256) making the artifact to be\npulled more specific, for example by referencing\n<code>oci://ghcr.io/security-profiles/runc@sha256:380…</code>.</p>\n<p>The operator internally caches pulled artifacts up to 24 hours for 1000\nprofiles, meaning that they will be refreshed after that time period, if the\ncache is full or the operator daemon gets restarted.</p>\n<p>Because the overall resulting syscalls are hidden from the user (I only have the\n<code>baseProfileName</code> listed in the SeccompProfile, and not the syscalls themselves), I'll additionally\nannotate that SeccompProfile with the final <code>syscalls</code>.</p>\n<p>Here's how the SeccompProfile looks after I annotate it:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-console\" data-lang=\"console\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#000080;font-weight:bold\">&gt;</span> kubectl describe seccompprofile <span style=\"color:#a2f\">test</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#888\">Name: test\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#888\">Namespace: security-profiles-operator\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#888\">Labels: spo.x-k8s.io/profile-id=SeccompProfile-test\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#888\">Annotations: syscalls:\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#888\"> [{&#34;names&#34;:[&#34;arch_prctl&#34;,&#34;brk&#34;,&#34;capget&#34;,&#34;capset&#34;,&#34;chdir&#34;,&#34;clone&#34;,&#34;close&#34;,...\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#888\">API Version: security-profiles-operator.x-k8s.io/v1beta1\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The SPO maintainers provide all public base profiles as part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/security-profiles/packages\">“Security\nProfiles” GitHub organization</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"managing-oci-security-profiles\">Managing OCI security profiles</h2>\n<p>Alright, now the official SPO provides a bunch of base profiles, but how can I\ndefine my own? Well, first of all we have to choose a working registry. There\nare a bunch of registries that already supports OCI artifacts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/distribution/distribution\">CNCF Distribution</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/acr\">Azure Container Registry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecr\">Amazon Elastic Container Registry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry\">Google Artifact Registry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry\">GitHub Packages container registry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bundle.bar/docs/supported-clients/oras\">Bundle Bar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hub.docker.com\">Docker Hub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://zotregistry.io\">Zot Registry</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Security Profiles Operator ships a new command line interface called <code>spoc</code>,\nwhich is a little helper tool for managing OCI profiles among doing various other\nthings which are out of scope of this blog post. But, the command <code>spoc push</code>\ncan be used to push a security profile to a registry:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>&gt; export USERNAME=my-user\n&gt; export PASSWORD=my-pass\n&gt; spoc push -f ./examples/baseprofile-crun.yaml ghcr.io/security-profiles/crun:v1.8.3\n16:35:43.899886 Pushing profile ./examples/baseprofile-crun.yaml to: ghcr.io/security-profiles/crun:v1.8.3\n16:35:43.899939 Creating file store in: /tmp/push-3618165827\n16:35:43.899947 Adding profile to store: ./examples/baseprofile-crun.yaml\n16:35:43.900061 Packing files\n16:35:43.900282 Verifying reference: ghcr.io/security-profiles/crun:v1.8.3\n16:35:43.900310 Using tag: v1.8.3\n16:35:43.900313 Creating repository for ghcr.io/security-profiles/crun\n16:35:43.900319 Using username and password\n16:35:43.900321 Copying profile to repository\n16:35:46.976108 Signing container image\nGenerating ephemeral keys...\nRetrieving signed certificate...\nNote that there may be personally identifiable information associated with this signed artifact.\nThis may include the email address associated with the account with which you authenticate.\nThis information will be used for signing this artifact and will be stored in public transparency logs and cannot be removed later.\nBy typing &#39;y&#39;, you attest that you grant (or have permission to grant) and agree to have this information stored permanently in transparency logs.\nYour browser will now be opened to:\nhttps://oauth2.sigstore.dev/auth/auth?access_type=…\nSuccessfully verified SCT...\ntlog entry created with index: 16520520\nPushing signature to: ghcr.io/security-profiles/crun\n</code></pre><p>You can see that the tool automatically signs the artifact and pushes the\n<code>./examples/baseprofile-crun.yaml</code> to the registry, which is then directly ready\nfor usage within the SPO. If username and password authentication is required,\neither use the <code>--username</code>, <code>-u</code> flag or export the <code>USERNAME</code> environment\nvariable. To set the password, export the <code>PASSWORD</code> environment variable.</p>\n<p>It is possible to add custom annotations to the security profile by using the\n<code>--annotations</code> / <code>-a</code> flag multiple times in <code>KEY:VALUE</code> format. Those have no\neffect for now, but at some later point additional features of the operator may\nrely them.</p>\n<p>The <code>spoc</code> client is also able to pull security profiles from OCI artifact\ncompatible registries.

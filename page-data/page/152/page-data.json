As a CNI provider, Cilium extends the orchestrator&rsquo;s existing network capabilities by giving teams more control over how they build their applications and monitor traffic. For example, vanilla Kubernetes installations typically rely on traditional firewalls and Linux-based network utilities like iptables to filter pod-to-pod traffic by an IP address or port. But managing network communication with standard firewall rules is more difficult when these environments experience high rates of churn among pods—and consequently IP addresses.","PublishedAt":"2022-07-25 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/cilium-metrics-and-architecture/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1011,"Title":"Monitor Cilium and Kubernetes performance with Hubble","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitor-cilium-and-kubernetes-performance-with-hubble/cilium_part2_hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>In Part 1, we looked at some key metrics for monitoring the health and performance of your Cilium-managed Kubernetes clusters and network.

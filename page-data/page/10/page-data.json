This feature aims to provide more useful logs\nfor better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-contextual-logging\">What is contextual logging?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3077-contextual-logging\">Contextual logging</a>\nis based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/go-logr/logr#a-minimal-logging-api-for-go\">go-logr</a> API.\nThe key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller\nand use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.\nThe binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries.\nThe go-logr API is designed around structured logging and supports attaching\nadditional information to a logger.</p>\n<p>This enables additional use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The caller can attach additional information to a logger:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr#Logger.WithName\">WithName</a> adds a &quot;logger&quot; key with the names concatenated by a dot as value</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-logr/logr#Logger.WithValues\">WithValues</a> adds key/value pairs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When passing this extended logger into a function, and the function uses it\ninstead of the global logger, the additional information is then included\nin all log entries, without having to modify the code that generates the log entries.\nThis is useful in highly parallel applications where it can become hard to identify\nall log entries for a certain operation, because the output from different operations gets interleaved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When running unit tests, log output can be associated with the current test.\nThen, when a test fails, only the log output of the failed test gets shown by go test.\nThat output can also be more verbose by default because it will not get shown for successful tests.\nTests can be run in parallel without interleaving their output.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the design decisions for contextual logging was to allow attaching a logger as value to a <code>context.Context</code>.\nSince the logger encapsulates all aspects of the intended logging for the call,\nit is <em>part</em> of the context, and not just <em>using</em> it. A practical advantage is that many APIs\nalready have a <code>ctx</code> parameter or can add one. This provides additional advantages, like being able to\nget rid of <code>context.TODO()</code> calls inside the functions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-it\">How to use it</h2>\n<p>The contextual logging feature is alpha starting from Kubernetes v1.24,\nso it requires the <code>ContextualLogging</code> <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a> to be enabled.\nIf you want to test the feature while it is alpha, you need to enable this feature gate\non the <code>kube-controller-manager</code> and the <code>kube-scheduler</code>.</p>\n<p>For the <code>kube-scheduler</code>, there is one thing to note, in addition to enabling\nthe <code>ContextualLogging</code> feature gate, instrumentation also depends on log verbosity.\nTo avoid slowing down the scheduler with the logging instrumentation for contextual logging added for 1.29,\nit is important to choose carefully when to add additional information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At <code>-v3</code> or lower, only <code>WithValues(&quot;pod&quot;)</code> is used once per scheduling cycle.\nThis has the intended effect that all log messages for the cycle include the pod information.\nOnce contextual logging is GA, &quot;pod&quot; key/value pairs can be removed from all log calls.</li>\n<li>At <code>-v4</code> or higher, richer log entries get produced where <code>WithValues</code> is also used for the node (when applicable)\nand <code>WithName</code> is used for the current operation and plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is an example that demonstrates the effect:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I1113 08:43:37.029524 87144 default_binder.go:53] &quot;Attempting to bind pod to node&quot; <strong>logger=&quot;Bind.DefaultBinder&quot;</strong> <strong>pod</strong>=&quot;kube-system/coredns-69cbfb9798-ms4pq&quot; <strong>node</strong>=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The immediate benefit is that the operation and plugin name are visible in <code>logger</code>.\n<code>pod</code> and <code>node</code> are already logged as parameters in individual log calls in <code>kube-scheduler</code> code.\nOnce contextual logging is supported by more packages outside of <code>kube-scheduler</code>,\nthey will also be visible there (for example, client-go). Once it is GA,\nlog calls can be simplified to avoid repeating those values.</p>\n<p>In <code>kube-controller-manager</code>, <code>WithName</code> is used to add the user-visible controller name to log output,\nfor example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I1113 08:43:29.284360 87141 graph_builder.go:285] &quot;garbage controller monitor not synced: no monitors&quot; <strong>logger=&quot;garbage-collector-controller&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>logger=”garbage-collector-controller”</code> was added by the <code>kube-controller-manager</code> core\nwhen instantiating that controller and appears in all of its log entries - at least as long as the code\nthat it calls supports contextual logging. Further work is needed to convert shared packages like client-go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance-impact\">Performance impact</h2>\n<p>Supporting contextual logging in a package, i.e. accepting a logger from a caller, is cheap.\nNo performance impact was observed for the <code>kube-scheduler</code>. As noted above,\nadding <code>WithName</code> and <code>WithValues</code> needs to be done more carefully.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes 1.29, enabling contextual logging at production verbosity (<code>-v3</code> or lower)\ncaused no measurable slowdown for the <code>kube-scheduler</code> and is not expected for the <code>kube-controller-manager</code> either.\nAt debug levels, a 28% slowdown for some test cases is still reasonable given that the resulting logs make debugging easier.\nFor details, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/4219#issuecomment-1807811995\">discussion around promoting the feature to beta</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"impact-on-downstream-users\">Impact on downstream users</h2>\n<p>Log output is not part of the Kubernetes API and changes regularly in each release,\nwhether it is because developers work on the code or because of the ongoing conversion\nto structured and contextual logging.</p>\n<p>If downstream users have dependencies on specific logs,\nthey need to be aware of how this change affects them.</p>\n<h2

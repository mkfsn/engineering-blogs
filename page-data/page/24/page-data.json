Gateway API is just weeks away from graduating to GA, if you\nhaven't upgraded yet, now's the time to think about it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>In the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes, networking plays a pivotal role. As more applications are\ndeployed in Kubernetes clusters, effective exposure of these services to clients becomes a critical\nconcern. If you've been working with Kubernetes, you're likely familiar with the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/\">Ingress API</a>,\nwhich has been the go-to solution for managing external access to services.</p>\n<p>The Ingress API provides a way to route external traffic to your applications within the cluster,\nmaking it an indispensable tool for many Kubernetes users. Ingress has its limitations however, and\nas applications become more complex and the demands on your Kubernetes clusters increase, these\nlimitations can become bottlenecks.</p>\n<p>Some of the limitations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Insufficient common denominator</strong> - by attempting to establish a common denominator for various\nHTTP proxies, Ingress can only accommodate basic HTTP routing, forcing more features of\ncontemporary proxies like traffic splitting and header matching into provider-specific,\nnon-transferable annotations.</li>\n<li><strong>Inadequate permission model</strong> - Ingress spec configures both infrastructure and application\nconfiguration in one object. With Ingress, the cluster operator and application developer operate\non the same Ingress object without being aware of each other’s roles. This creates an insufficient\nrole-based access control and has high potential for setup errors.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of protocol diversity</strong> - Ingress primarily focuses on HTTP(S) routing and does not provide\nnative support for other protocols, such as TCP, UDP and gRPC. This limitation makes it less\nsuitable for handling non-HTTP workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"gateway-api\">Gateway API</h2>\n<p>To overcome this, Gateway API is designed to provide a more flexible, extensible, and powerful way\nto manage traffic to your services.</p>\n<p>Gateway API is just weeks away from a GA (General Availability) release. It provides a standard\nKubernetes API for ingress traffic control. It offers extended functionality, improved\ncustomization, and greater flexibility. By focusing on modular and expressive API resources, Gateway\nAPI makes it possible to describe a wider array of routing configurations and models.</p>\n<p>The transition from Ingress API to Gateway API in Kubernetes is driven by advantages and advanced\nfunctionalities that Gateway API offers, with its foundation built on four core principles: a\nrole-oriented approach, portability, expressiveness and extensibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-role-oriented-approach\">A role-oriented approach</h3>\n<p>Gateway API employs a role-oriented approach that aligns with the conventional roles within\norganizations involved in configuring Kubernetes service networking. This approach enables\ninfrastructure engineers, cluster operators, and application developers to collectively address\ndifferent aspects of Gateway API.</p>\n<p>For instance, infrastructure engineers play a pivotal role in deploying GatewayClasses,\ncluster-scoped resources that act as templates to explicitly define behavior for Gateways derived\nfrom them, laying the groundwork for robust service networking.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, cluster operators utilize these GatewayClasses to deploy gateways. A Gateway in\nKubernetes' Gateway API defines how external traffic can be directed to Services within the cluster,\nessentially bridging non-Kubernetes sources to Kubernetes-aware destinations. It represents a\nrequest for a load balancer configuration aligned with a GatewayClass’ specification. The Gateway\nspec may not be exhaustive as some details can be supplied by the GatewayClass controller, ensuring\nportability. Additionally, a Gateway can be linked to multiple Route references to channel specific\ntraffic subsets to designated services.</p>\n<p>Lastly, application developers configure route resources (such as HTTPRoutes), to manage\nconfiguration (e.g. timeouts, request matching/filter) and Service composition (e.g. path routing to\nbackends) Route resources define protocol-specific rules for mapping requests from a Gateway to\nKubernetes Services. HTTPRoute is for multiplexing HTTP or terminated HTTPS connections. It's\nintended for use in cases where you want to inspect the HTTP stream and use HTTP request data for\neither routing or modification, for example using HTTP Headers for routing, or modifying them\nin-flight.</p>\n<figure class=\"diagram-medium\">\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/10/25/introducing-ingress2gateway/gateway-api-resources.svg\"\nalt=\"Diagram showing the key resources that make up Gateway API and how they relate to each other. The resources shown are GatewayClass, Gateway, and HTTPRoute; the Service API is also shown\"/>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"portability\">Portability</h3>\n<p>With more than 20 <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/implementations/#implementations\">API\nimplementations</a>, Gateway API is\ndesigned to be more portable across different implementations, clusters and environments. It helps\nreduce Ingress' reliance on non-portable, provider-specific annotations, making your configurations\nmore consistent and easier to manage across multiple clusters.</p>\n<p>Gateway API commits to supporting the 5 latest Kubernetes minor versions. That means that Gateway\nAPI currently supports Kubernetes 1.24+.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expressiveness\">Expressiveness</h3>\n<p>Gateway API provides standard, Kubernetes-backed support for a wide range of features, such as\nheader-based matching, traffic splitting, weight-based routing, request mirroring and more. With\nIngress, these features need custom provider-specific annotations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"extensibility\">Extensibility</h3>\n<p>Gateway API is designed with extensibility as a core feature. Rather than enforcing a\none-size-fits-all model, it offers the flexibility to link custom resources at multiple layers\nwithin the API's framework. This layered approach to customization ensures that users can tailor\nconfigurations to their specific needs without overwhelming the main structure. By doing so, Gateway\nAPI facilitates more granular and context-sensitive adjustments, allowing for a fine-tuned balance\nbetween standardization and adaptability. This becomes particularly valuable in complex cloud-native\nenvironments where specific use cases require nuanced configurations. A critical difference is that\nGateway API has a much broader base set of features and a standard pattern for extensions that can\nbe more expressive than annotations were on Ingress.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-gateway\">Upgrading to Gateway</h2>\n<p>Migrating from Ingress to Gateway API may seem intimidating, but luckily Kubernetes just released a\ntool to simplify the process. <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway\">ingress2gateway</a>\nassists in the migration by converting your existing Ingress resources into Gateway API resources.\nHere is how you can get started with Gateway API and using ingress2gateway:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-a-gateway-controller\">Install a Gateway\ncontroller</a> OR <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api\">install\nthe Gateway API CRDs manually</a> .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Install <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway\">ingress2gateway</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a Go development environment locally, you can install <code>ingress2gateway</code> with:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>go install github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway@v0.1.0\n</code></pre><p>This installs <code>ingress2gateway</code> to <code>$(go env GOPATH)/bin/ingress2gateway</code>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, follow the installation guide\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway#installation\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the tool is installed, you can use it to convert the ingress resources in your cluster to\nGateway API resources.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>ingress2gateway print\n</code></pre><p>This above command will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Load your current Kubernetes client config including the active context, namespace and\nauthentication details.</li>\n<li>Search for ingresses and provider-specific resources in that namespace.</li>\n<li>Convert them to Gateway API resources (Currently only Gateways and HTTPRoutes). For other\noptions you can run the tool with <code>-h</code>, or refer to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway#options\">https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/ingress2gateway#options</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Review the converted Gateway API resources, validate them, and then apply them to your cluster.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send test requests to your Gateway to check that it is working. You could get your gateway\naddress using <code>kubectl get gateway &lt;gateway-name&gt; -n &lt;namespace&gt; -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses}{&quot;\\n&quot;}'</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update your DNS to point to the new Gateway.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once you've confirmed that no more traffic is going through your Ingress configuration, you can\nsafely delete it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Achieving reliable, scalable and extensible networking has always been a challenging objective. The\nGateway API is designed to improve the current Kubernetes networking standards like ingress and\nreduce the need for implementation specific annotations and CRDs.</p>\n<p>It is a Kubernetes standard API, consistent across different platforms and implementations and most\nimportantly it is future proof. Gateway API is the next generation of the Ingress API, but has a\nlarger scope than that, expanding to tackle mesh and layer 4 routing as well. Gateway API and\ningress2gateway are supported by a dedicated team under SIG Network that actively work on it and\nmanage the ecosystem. It is also likely to receive more updates and community support.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-road-ahead\">The Road Ahead</h3>\n<p>ingress2gateway is just getting started. We're planning to onboard more providers, introduce support\nfor more types of Gateway API routes, and make sure everything syncs up smoothly with the ongoing\ndevelopment of Gateway API.</p>\n<p>Excitingly, Gateway API is also making significant strides. While v1.0 is about to launching,\nthere's still a lot of work ahead. This release incorporates many new experimental features, with\nadditional functionalities currently in the early stages of planning and development.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in helping to contribute, we would love to have you!

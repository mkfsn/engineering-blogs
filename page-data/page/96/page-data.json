On the 3rd of April 2023, the old registry <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related subprojects will be pushed to the old registry.</p>\n<p>This registry <code>registry.k8s.io</code> replaced the old one and has been generally available for several months. We have published a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/11/28/registry-k8s-io-faster-cheaper-ga/\">blog post</a> about its benefits to the community and the Kubernetes project.

Please read the timelines below for details of the final patch releases in the old registry.</li>\n<li>Starting in 1.25, the default image registry has been set to <code>registry.k8s.io</code>. This value is overridable in <code>kubeadm</code> and <code>kubelet</code> but setting it to <code>k8s.gcr.io</code> will fail for new releases after April as they won’t be present in the old registry.</li>\n<li>If you want to increase the reliability of your cluster and remove dependency on the community-owned registry or you are running Kubernetes in networks where external traffic is restricted, you should consider hosting local image registry mirrors.

In the context of Kubernetes, having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial.</p>\n<p>SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the <em>Api server</em>, <em>scheduler</em>, <em>kubelet</em> and <em>kube-controller-manager</em>.</p>\n<p>In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/imrannoormohamed/\">Imran Noor Mohamed</a>, SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ehashdn\">Elana Hashman</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hankang\">Han Kang</a>, chairs of SIG Instrumentation, on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-instrumentation\">About SIG Instrumentation</h2>\n<p><strong>Imran (INM)</strong>: Hello, thank you for the opportunity of learning more about SIG Instrumentation. Could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in SIG Instrumentation?</p>\n<p><strong>Han (HK)</strong>: I started in SIG Instrumentation in 2018, and became a chair in 2020. I primarily got involved with SIG instrumentation due to a number of upstream issues with metrics which ended up affecting GKE in bad ways. As a result, we ended up launching an initiative to stabilize our metrics and make metrics a proper API.</p>\n<p><strong>Elana (EH)</strong>: I also joined SIG Instrumentation in 2018 and became a chair at the same time as Han. I was working as a site reliability engineer (SRE) on bare metal Kubernetes clusters and was working to build out our observability stack. I encountered some issues with label joins where Kubernetes metrics didn’t match kube-state-metrics (<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics\">KSM</a>) and started participating in SIG meetings to improve things. I helped test performance improvements to kube-state-metrics and ultimately coauthored a KEP for overhauling metrics in the 1.14 release to improve usability.</p>\n<p><strong>Imran (INM)</strong>: Interesting! Does that mean SIG Instrumentation involves a lot of plumbing?</p>\n<p><strong>Han (HK)</strong>: I wouldn’t say it involves a ton of plumbing, though it does touch basically every code base. We have our own dedicated directories for our metrics, logs, and tracing frameworks which we tend to work out of primarily. We do have to interact with other SIGs in order to propagate our changes which makes us more of a horizontal SIG.</p>\n<p><strong>Imran (INM)</strong>: Speaking about interaction and coordination with other SIG could you describe how the SIGs is organized?</p>\n<p><strong>Elana (EH)</strong>: In SIG Instrumentation, we have two chairs, Han and myself, as well as two tech leads, David Ashpole and Damien Grisonnet. We all work together as the SIG’s leads in order to run meetings, triage issues and PRs, review and approve KEPs, plan for each release, present at KubeCon and community meetings, and write our annual report. Within the SIG we also have a number of important subprojects, each of which is stewarded by its subproject owners. For example, Marek Siarkowicz is a subproject owner of <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server\">metrics-server</a>.</p>\n<p>Because we’re a horizontal SIG, some of our projects have a wide scope and require coordination from a dedicated group of contributors. For example, in order to guide the Kubernetes migration to structured logging, we chartered the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-structured-logging/README.md\">Structured Logging</a> Working Group (WG), organized by Marek and Patrick Ohly. The WG doesn’t own any code, but helps with various components such as the <em>kubelet</em>, <em>scheduler</em>, etc. in migrating their code to use structured logs.</p>\n<p><strong>Imran (INM)</strong>: Walking through the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-instrumentation/charter.md\">charter</a> alone it’s clear that SIG Instrumentation has a lot of sub-projects. Could you highlight some important ones?</p>\n<p><strong>Han (HK)</strong>: We have many different sub-projects and we are in dire need of people who can come and help shepherd them. Our most important projects in-tree (that is, within the kubernetes/kubernetes repo) are metrics, tracing, and, structured logging. Our most important projects out-of-tree are (a) KSM (kube-state-metrics) and (b) metrics-server.</p>\n<p><strong>Elana (EH)</strong>: Echoing this, we would love to bring on more maintainers for kube-state-metrics and metrics-server. Our friends at WG Structured Logging are also looking for contributors. Other subprojects include klog, prometheus-adapter, and a new subproject that we just launched for collecting high-fidelity, scalable utilization metrics called <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/usage-metrics-collector\">usage-metrics-collector</a>. All are seeking new contributors!</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-status-and-ongoing-challenges\">Current status and ongoing challenges</h2>\n<p><strong>Imran (INM)</strong>: For release <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.26\">1.26</a> we can see that there are a relevant number of metrics, logs, and tracing <a href=\"https://www.k8s.dev/resources/keps/\">KEPs</a> in the pipeline. Would you like to point out important things for last release (maybe alpha &amp; stable milestone candidates?)</p>\n<p><strong>Han (HK)</strong>: We can now generate <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/instrumentation/metrics/\">documentation</a> for every single metric in the main Kubernetes code base! We have a pretty fancy static analysis pipeline that enables this functionality. We’ve also added feature metrics so that you can look at your metrics to determine which features are enabled in your cluster at a given time. Lastly, we added a component-sli endpoint, which should make it easy for people to create availability SLOs for <em>control-plane</em> components.</p>\n<p><strong>Elana (EH)</strong>: We’ve also been working on tracing KEPs for both the <em>API server</em> and <em>kubelet</em>, though neither graduated in 1.26. I’m also really excited about the work Han is doing with WG Reliability to extend and improve our metrics stability framework.</p>\n<p><strong>Imran (INM)</strong>: What do you think are the Kubernetes-specific challenges tackled by the SIG Instrumentation? What are the future efforts to solve them?</p>\n<p><strong>Han (HK)</strong>: SIG instrumentation suffered a bit in the past from being a horizontal SIG. We did not have an obvious location to put our code and did not have a good mechanism to audit metrics that people would randomly add. We’ve fixed this over the years and now we have dedicated spots for our code and a reliable mechanism for auditing new metrics. We also now offer stability guarantees for metrics. We hope to have full-blown tracing up and down the kubernetes stack, and metric support via exemplars.</p>\n<p><strong>Elana (EH)</strong>: I think SIG Instrumentation is a really interesting SIG because it poses different kinds of opportunities to get involved than in other SIGs. You don’t have to be a software developer to contribute to our SIG! All of our components and subprojects are focused on better understanding Kubernetes and its performance in production, which allowed me to get involved as one of the few SIG Chairs working as an SRE at that time. I like that we provide opportunities for newcomers to contribute through using, testing, and providing feedback on our subprojects, which is a lower barrier to entry. Because many of these projects are out-of-tree, I think one of our challenges is to figure out what’s in scope for core Kubernetes SIGs instrumentation subprojects, what’s missing, and then fill in the gaps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"community-and-contribution\">Community and contribution</h2>\n<p><strong>Imran (INM)</strong>: Kubernetes values community over products. Any recommendation for anyone looking into getting involved in SIG Instrumentation work? Where should they start (new contributor-friendly areas within SIG?)</p>\n<p><strong>Han(HK) and Elana (EH)</strong>: Come to our bi-weekly triage <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation#meetings\">meetings</a>! They aren’t recorded and are a great place to ask questions and learn about our ongoing work. We strive to be a friendly community and one of the easiest SIGs to get started with.

When it comes to sophisticated attacks, one of the most commonly seen tactics is Lateral Movement. During lateral movement, many attackers try impersonating a legitimate user by abusing admin tools (e.g., SMB, SAMBA, FTP, WMI, WinRM, and PowerShell Remoting) to move laterally from system to system in search of sensitive information. In addition, they may avoid using traditional malware to stay beneath the security radar, making detection more difficult.</p>\n<p>This publication will discuss the newly available <a href=\"https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/lmd\">Lateral Movement Detection package</a> under Kibana’s integrations app. Our new package includes anomaly detection jobs and security rules and takes advantage of the endpoint malware classifier to make finding Lateral Movement in your network simpler.</p>\n<h2 id=\"briefintroductiontolateralmovement\">Brief introduction to Lateral Movement</h2>\n<p>Lateral movement is a class of techniques used by adversaries to access resources in an enterprise that may store valuable data or sensitive information. For the purposes of our package, it also pertains to remote execution events that leverage the same protocols. These techniques play an essential role in the mobility of attackers who have established a foothold in the network and need to access one or more other systems until they achieve their ultimate objective(s). This may include accessing or destroying sensitive files and running a malicious payload on the target system.</p>\n<p>Intrusions can escalate quickly as adversaries attempt to outmaneuver security technologies and analysts. Preventative measures such as enterprise controls (segmentation), endpoint capabilities (sensors with detection capabilities), and user entity behavior analytics (UEBA) exist, but none of these can address all the possible use cases alone. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ourapproach\">Our approach</h2>\n<p>Typically, attackers rely on built-in protocols to deploy malicious software on victim hosts or to move data outside the enterprise network. Evaluating the use of these protocols is a key aspect of how Elastic escalates these behaviors to your attention.</p>\n<p>Our new <strong>Lateral Movement Detection</strong> framework complements behavioral and endpoint detections to provide mitigations against malicious software. In addition, several anomaly detection jobs are employed to profile host-to-host file transfer behavior. To monitor file transfers at the endpoint, we look for file “creation” events with a “process.name” of “smbd,” “system,” “vsftpd,” “sftp-server,” “sshd,” or “scp.” The aforementioned “process.name” values correspond to the five most commonly used file-transfer protocols for Windows and Linux hosts (e.g., SAMBA, SMB/PS Remoting, FTP, SFTP, SSH, and SCP). For this package, we decided to start with these services first with the aim of expanding the capability in future releases.</p>\n<p>The table below demonstrates a host to host matrix with their respective services:\n<img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltae94021bd849dd7b/63dab920df2bf910c8031770/Table1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>We filter file creation events based on the above table and use file metadata such as file size, extension, and directory to profile hosts for abnormal file transfer activities using anomaly detection jobs. These jobs flag potentially malicious activity by looking for spikes in file creation events, large amounts of data transfer, and rare file extensions and directories. Such outliers in the file transfer activities and metadata could indicate compromise, and may suggest that someone is trying to move malicious content across the network.  </p>\n<p>The following flowchart depicts the Lateral Movement Detection package at work (note numbers are examples for illustrative purposes)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd47b6531753c3c19/63daba42c8540a111ada8be6/image9.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Moreover, our package also uses detection rules and endpoint features like the MalwareScore classifier — mixing and matching features to add confidence. For instance, we look for file “creation” and “modification” in sensitive directories, (e.g., admin shares for windows, dot, config, and bin files for Linux). Adversaries may attempt to create or modify files in folders like “bin,” where they can execute a malicious binary hidden among legitimate ones. In addition, we use the correlation between remote file creation events and MalwareScore detections to identify a malicious file transfer, one of the most common ways malware propagates in an enterprise. Our model is trained on a diverse feature set, allowing it to learn all the patterns in data pointing toward a malicious file. Finding and implementing these patterns using behavioral logic is tedious and could result in more noise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>As of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-8-6-0\">8.6</a>, users can install the <a href=\"https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/lmd\">Lateral Movement Detection package</a> from the Integrations app in Kibana. If you don’t have an Elastic Cloud cluster but would like to start experimenting with the package, you can <a href=\"https://cloud.elastic.co/registration\">start a free 14-day trial</a> of Elastic Cloud.</p>\n<p>To set up and begin using the Lateral Movement Detection package, follow the steps listed below. </p>\n<h3 id=\"step1installingthepackage\">Step 1: Installing the package</h3>\n<p>In the Kibana integration app, the new Lateral Movement Detection package is available. To install, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and click on <strong>Install Lateral Movement Detection assets</strong>. This will install all the artifacts under this package to generate events and alerts when Lateral Movement is detected in the file transfer activity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbc8c1b2399305c59/63dabaefb369f5745550cb74/image3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"step2runninganomalydetectionjobs\">Step 2: Running anomaly detection jobs</h3>\n<p>As discussed above, this package consists of several prebuilt anomaly detection jobs. To run these jobs, go to <strong>Machine Learning > Anomaly Detection</strong>. Go to the <strong>Jobs</strong> wizard under <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> and click on <strong>Create job</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt33c25538544d0889/63dabc1fe4e29e75dc5df15c/image8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Select the <strong>Lateral Movement Detection</strong> card under the Use preconfigured jobs option and click on the <strong>Create jobs</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt089e8f4ba2c7663c/63dabcf88e456d21046c7d1b/image1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"step3enablingsecuritydetectionrules\">Step 3: Enabling security detection rules</h3>\n<p>This package uses anomaly detection jobs, security rules, and the endpoint malware classifier to detect lateral movement in the network. To see all the Lateral Movement Detection alerts, you need to enable all the installed detection rules under the package. The rules based on anomaly detection jobs are triggered when the anomaly score surpasses a predetermined threshold which can be customized by duplicating the detection rule. </p>\n<p>To enable and use the installed rules, navigate to <strong>Security > Alerts > Manage rules</strong> and select** Load Elastic prebuild rules and timeline templates**. If you’re running in Elastic Cloud, this step is done automatically.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4305ca36ebf0f392/63dabd823d28dd4dde642c67/image5.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You can use the <strong>Lateral Movement Detection</strong> tag to filter for all the detection rules under this package.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc1096222f3ca421a/63dabdda5d9574542d40b99c/image2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>To enable a specific rule, click on the <strong>Enabled</strong> toggle corresponding to the rule name.

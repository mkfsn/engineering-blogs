Otherwise, the time you’ll spend combing through monitoring data for context, connecting to hosts and other infrastructure resources, and pivoting between consoles for various managed services can add up quickly and slow your response.By integrating your ops tools into your monitoring stack, you can cut down on context switching to perform complex monitoring and remediation tasks faster.","PublishedAt":"2023-11-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-app-builder-low-code-internal-tools/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":5118,"Title":"Discover, triage, and remediate sensitive data issues at scale with Sensitive Data Scanner","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/scaling-sensitive-data-scanner/scaling-sds-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Managing sensitive information in your telemetry data poses many challenges to governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) teams and overall security. Organizations in healthcare, finance, insurance, and other fields must carefully adhere to strict compliance requirements. But sensitive data comes in many forms and moves between many endpoints, and as a result, it can easily become exposed in telemetry data. What’s more, as organizations scale, troubleshooting and triaging sensitive data issues becomes an increasingly complex process, and the risks of alert fatigue, mismanagement, and oversights grow higher.","PublishedAt":"2023-11-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/scaling-sensitive-data-scanner/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":5119,"Title":"Easily identify and prioritize your top security risks with Datadog Security Inbox","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/security-inbox/security-inbox-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>In today&rsquo;s complex cloud environments, security and engineering teams need to manage vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across multiple layers of the stack, including cloud resources, clusters, containers, and applications. Often, this results in a lengthy list of problems that lacks prioritization and is daunting for users to address.Adding to the complexity, security teams often lack the ability to directly remediate vulnerabilities—they must partner with DevOps teams to address these findings at the resource level and achieve the security outcome customers expect.","PublishedAt":"2023-11-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/security-inbox/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":5120,"Title":"Enhance your troubleshooting workflow with Container Images in Datadog Container Monitoring","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/datadog-container-image-view/container-image-view-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Containers are powerful tools for scaling and deploying your applications, but with so many components pulled from different sources, there’s a greater potential for issues within them to go undetected.

HostProcess containers run as either the built-in Windows system accounts or\nephemeral users within a user group defined by you. HostProcess containers also share\nthe host's network namespace and access/configure storage mounts visible to the host.\nOn the other hand, Windows Server containers are highly isolated and exist in a separate\nexecution namespace. Direct access to the host from a Windows Server container is explicitly disallowed\nby default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2>\n<p>Windows HostProcess containers are implemented with Windows <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/job-objects\"><em>Job Objects</em></a>,\na break from the previous container model which use server silos.\nJob Objects are components of the Windows OS which offer the ability to\nmanage a group of processes as a group (also known as a <em>job</em>) and assign resource constraints to the\ngroup as a whole. Job objects are specific to the Windows OS and are not associated with\nthe Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/\">Job API</a>. They have no process\nor file system isolation,\nenabling the privileged payload to view and edit the host file system with the\ndesired permissions, among other host resources. The init process, and any processes\nit launches (including processes explicitly launched by the user) are all assigned to the\njob object of that container. When the init process exits or is signaled to exit,\nall the processes in the job will be signaled to exit, the job handle will be\nclosed and the storage will be unmounted.</p>\n<p>HostProcess and Linux privileged containers enable similar scenarios but differ\ngreatly in their implementation (hence the naming difference). HostProcess containers\nhave their own <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.25/#windowssecuritycontextoptions-v1-core\">PodSecurityContext</a> fields.\nThose used to configure Linux privileged containers <strong>do not</strong> apply. Enabling privileged access to a Windows host is a\nfundamentally different process than with Linux so the configuration and\ncapabilities of each differ significantly. Below is a diagram detailing the\noverall architecture of Windows HostProcess containers:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/13/windows-host-process-containers-ga/hpc_architecture.svg\"\nalt=\"HostProcess Architecture\"/>\n</figure>\n<p>Two major features were added prior to moving to stable: the ability to run as local user accounts, and\na simplified method of accessing volume mounts.

With one hand, they hold it high as a powerful resource, and with the other, they criticize some aspect of it. But regardless of your viewpoint on any given day, ATT&amp;CK is one of the most important resources for improving your understanding of threat capabilities and aligning those to technical controls, countermeasures, or mitigations. </p>\n<p>We at Elastic know a bit about ATT&amp;CK — not only as a tool for detection engineering, but also from our experience in the MITRE Engenuity ATT&amp;CK evaluations (link) — having participated since the very beginning. Our most recent MITRE evaluation <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-protects-against-ransomware-and-linux-threats-in-mitre-engenuity-round-4-eval\">results</a> were strong. </p>\n<p>Comprehension is, unfortunately, expensive — in terms of both time and other limited resources. ATT&amp;CK improves comprehension in a uniquely inexpensive way, aligning objectives (tactics) to capabilities (techniques and procedures) with: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Descriptions that explain each capability with examples</li>\n<li>References describing how techniques were used in the wild</li>\n<li>Links to resources like the Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elastic’s core mission and philosophy is based on the principles of <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/sponsor-posts/07292020-elastic.html\">openness</a> and transparency. It is in this spirit that we’re excited to announce our partnership with <a href=\"http://www.tidalcyber.com/\">Tidal Cyber</a> to improve transparency even further, and help Tidal and Elastic users understand the capabilities we’re providing in the language of ATT&amp;CK. Using Tidal’s free <a href=\"https://app.tidalcyber.com?utm_campaign=Community%20Edition&utm_source=elastic\">Community Edition</a>, users can access the registry of detections provided by different vendors and products, collection of Campaigns, Groups, and more from MITRE — then map them to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix, analyzing both coverage and gaps.</p>\n<p>Elastic embraces <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/about/free-and-open\">free and open software</a>, and shares our detection logic for well over 1,000 rules and signatures mapped to ATT&amp;CK. Many organizations rely on several security technologies to prepare a defense-in-depth strategy, and comparing Elastic capabilities side-by-side with other vendors helps indicate where that strategy has gaps.</p>\n<p>Where most vendors maintain their logic in closed sources, ours at Elastic is fully transparent. Because Elastic champions community-facing development, that also means you have a role to play. We invite you to share in our development processes and ensure our technology is something you can expect for yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request we close a gap by opening an issue in one of our public repositories</li>\n<li>Submit a rule of your own that benefits the community</li>\n<li>Tell us about noisy rules and help us improve them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The edge of your enterprise is more than just your user workstations and servers. It extends to essential technologies you may not have direct control over. Elastic has been working to address this kind of complexity since the creation of the Elastic Security solution, which is why we began <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/rules/integrations/\">sharing logic</a> for enterprise applications like Okta and cloud service providers like AWS as early as 7.9 version. We support Tidal’s effort to make it easier for users to assess Enterprise ATT&amp;CK coverage, and seize control of their environments. </p>\n<p>What we see is that threats are moving faster, they’re hitting harder, and organizations are at a distinct disadvantage when they can’t answer basic questions about coverage. You don’t know what you don’t know (or what your vendor keeps locked away as intellectual property), and we’re teaming up with Tidal to ensure we’re part of the solution and not the problem. </p>\n<p>We enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODPfny9xAY4&feature=youtu.be\">our fireside chat</a> with Tidal, during which we shared our thoughts on rule development in and with the community and the importance of free and open security solutions. We’d love to hear from you about how we’re doing. </p>\n<p>Join our <a href=\"http://elasticstack.slack.com\">Slack community</a> to share your thoughts about putting MITRE ATT&amp;CK to good use in your enterprise, maintaining and optimizing coverage.</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-12-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-tidal-making-mitre-att-ck-easier","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2519,"Title":"AWS Week in Review – December 12, 2022","Description":"This post is part of our Week in Review series.

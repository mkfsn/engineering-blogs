As of Kubernetes v1.27, this feature is\nnow beta. Ordinals can start from arbitrary\nnon-negative numbers. This blog post will discuss how this feature can be\nused.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n<p>StatefulSets ordinals provide sequential identities for pod replicas. When using\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#orderedready-pod-management\"><code>OrderedReady</code> Pod management</a>\nPods are created from ordinal index <code>0</code> up to <code>N-1</code>.</p>\n<p>With Kubernetes today, orchestrating a StatefulSet migration across clusters is\nchallenging. Backup and restore solutions exist, but these require the\napplication to be scaled down to zero replicas prior to migration. In today's\nfully connected world, even planned application downtime may not allow you to\nmeet your business goals. You could use\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#cascading-delete\">Cascading Delete</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#on-delete\">On Delete</a>\nto migrate individual pods, however this is error prone and tedious to manage.\nYou lose the self-healing benefit of the StatefulSet controller when your Pods\nfail or are evicted.</p>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.26 enables a StatefulSet to be responsible for a range of ordinals\nwithin a range {0..N-1} (the ordinals 0, 1, ... up to N-1).\nWith it, you can scale down a range\n{0..k-1} in a source cluster, and scale up the complementary range {k..N-1}\nin a destination cluster, while maintaining application availability. This\nenables you to retain <em>at most one</em> semantics (meaning there is at most one Pod\nwith a given identity running in a StatefulSet) and\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#rolling-update\">Rolling Update</a>\nbehavior when orchestrating a migration across clusters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-would-i-want-to-use-this-feature\">Why would I want to use this feature?</h2>\n<p>Say you're running your StatefulSet in one cluster, and need to migrate it out\nto a different cluster. There are many reasons why you would need to do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Your StatefulSet has scaled too large for your cluster, and\nhas started to disrupt the quality of service for other workloads in your\ncluster.</li>\n<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: You're running a StatefulSet in a cluster that is accessed\nby multiple users, and namespace isolation isn't sufficient.</li>\n<li><strong>Cluster Configuration</strong>: You want to move your StatefulSet to a different\ncluster to use some environment that is not available on your current\ncluster.</li>\n<li><strong>Control Plane Upgrades</strong>: You want to move your StatefulSet to a cluster\nrunning an upgraded control plane, and can't handle the risk or downtime of\nin-place control plane upgrades.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>Enable the <code>StatefulSetStartOrdinal</code> feature gate on a cluster, and create a\nStatefulSet with a customized <code>.spec.ordinals.start</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"try-it-out\">Try it out</h2>\n<p>In this demo, I'll use the new mechanism to migrate a\nStatefulSet from one Kubernetes cluster to another.

To overcome these challenges, developers can use Flagsmith, an open source feature flagging and remote configuration service that allows developers to easily roll out and test new features for a specific subset of users. With Flagsmith, developers don&rsquo;t have to worry about deploying new code to test features, and instead can wrap existing code within a feature flag across web, mobile, and server-side applications that can then be toggled on and off from the Flagsmith UI.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/flagsmith-datadog-marketplace/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3521,"Title":"Track and improve the performance of streaming data pipelines with Datadog Data Streams Monitoring","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/data-streams-monitoring/hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>When managing queues and services in streaming data pipelines that use technologies like Kafka and RabbitMQ, SREs and application developers often struggle to determine if these pipelines are performing as expected. Visibility into the performance of a streaming data pipeline, after all, requires visibility into every component of that pipeline. Any issue at any step—whether it originates from a producer or consumer, a hot shard in a queue, or the underlying infrastructure—can cause data and events to be delayed, which increases latency and lag.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/data-streams-monitoring/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3524,"Title":"Monitor your TeamCity builds with Datadog CI Visibility","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/teamcity-ci-visibility/hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>As the complexity of modern software development lifecycles increase, it&rsquo;s important to have a comprehensive monitoring solution for your continuous integration (CI) pipelines so that you can quickly pinpoint and triage issues, especially when you have a large number of pipelines running.Datadog now offers deep, end-to-end visibility into your TeamCity builds with our new TeamCity integration for CI Pipeline Visibility, helping you identify bottlenecks in your CI system, track and address performance regressions, and proactively improve the efficiency of your CI system.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/teamcity-ci-visibility/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":3605,"Title":"Collect payment details before creating an Intent","Description":"Integrating and upgrading to the Payment Element is now easier than ever with server-side confirmation and a new integration path that lets you collect payment details before creating a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred","SourceName":"Stripe"}},{"node":{"ID":3606,"Title":"BNPL support expanded globally","Description":"Businesses can now accept more buy now, pay later methods globally through one integration on Stripe: Klarna in AU, NZ, CA, CH, PT, PL, CZ, and GR; Affirm in CA.","PublishedAt":"2023-04-27 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://stripe.com/docs/payments/buy-now-pay-later","SourceName":"Stripe"}},{"node":{"ID":3515,"Title":"My Journey to Airbnb — Michael Kinoti","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-04-26 20:26:57+00:00","OriginURL":"https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/my-journey-to-airbnb-michael-kinoti-645d4c228d06?source=rss----53c7c27702d5---4","SourceName":"Airbnb"}},{"node":{"ID":3512,"Title":"Building Cloud Native Data Apps on Premises","Description":"<p>Data is core to decision making today and organizations often turn to the cloud to build modern data apps for faster access to valuable insights.

This is done through the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/v1.7.0/spec.md#nodestagevolume\"><code>NodeStageVolumeRequest</code></a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/v1.7.0/spec.md#nodepublishvolume\"><code>NodePublishVolumeRequest</code></a>\nCSI calls.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the CSI driver is expected to apply the <code>fsGroup</code> to the files in the volume using a\n<em>mount option</em>. As an example, <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver\">Azure File CSIDriver</a> utilizes the <code>gid</code> mount option to map\nthe <code>fsGroup</code> information to all the files in the volume.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that in the example above the kubelet refrains from directly\napplying the permission changes into the files and directories in that volume files.\nAdditionally, two policy definitions no longer have an effect: neither\n<code>.spec.fsGroupPolicy</code> for the CSIDriver object, nor\n<code>.spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy</code> for the Pod.</p>\n<p>For more details about the inner workings of this feature, check out the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-storage/2317-fsgroup-on-mount/\">enhancement proposal</a>\nand the <a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/support-fsgroup.html\">CSI Driver <code>fsGroup</code> Support</a>\nin the CSI developer documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-it-important\">Why is it important?</h2>\n<p>Without this feature, applying the fsGroup information to files is not possible in certain storage environments.</p>\n<p>For instance, Azure File does not support a concept of POSIX-style ownership and permissions\nof files. The CSI driver is only able to set the file permissions at the volume level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-use-it\">How do I use it?</h2>\n<p>This feature should be mostly transparent to users. If you maintain a CSI driver that should\nsupport this feature, read\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/support-fsgroup.html\">CSI Driver <code>fsGroup</code> Support</a>\nfor more information on how to support this feature in your CSI driver.</p>\n<p>Existing CSI drivers that do not support this feature will continue to work as usual:\nthey will not receive any <code>fsGroup</code> information from the kubelet. In addition to that,\nthe kubelet will continue to perform the ownership and permissions changes to files\nfor those volumes, according to the policies specified in <code>.spec.fsGroupPolicy</code> for the\nCSIDriver and <code>.spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy</code> for the relevant Pod.</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-12-23 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/12/23/kubernetes-12-06-fsgroup-on-mount/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":2639,"Title":"Best practices for continuous testing with Datadog","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/best-practices-datadog-continuous-testing/datadog-continuous-testing-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>In Parts 1 and 2, we looked at how you can build and maintain effective test suites.

If the exec plugin is enabled and the kubelet requires authentication information for an image\nthat matches against a plugin, the kubelet will execute the plugin binary, passing the <code>CredentialProviderRequest</code> API via stdin.

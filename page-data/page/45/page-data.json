With the release of Kubernetes 1.28, that API is now Generally Available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-problem-does-it-solve\">What problem does it solve?</h2>\n<p>The kubelet can allocate exclusive resources to containers, like\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/\">CPUs, granting exclusive access to full cores</a>\nor <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/memory-manager/\">memory, either regions or hugepages</a>.\nWorkloads which require high performance, or low latency (or both) leverage these features.\nThe kubelet also can assign <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/\">devices to containers</a>.\nCollectively, these features which enable exclusive assignments are known as &quot;resource managers&quot;.</p>\n<p>Without an API like podresources, the only possible option to learn about resource assignment was to read the state files the\nresource managers use. While done out of necessity, the problem with this approach is the path and the format of these file are\nboth internal implementation details. Albeit very stable, the project reserves the right to change them freely.\nConsuming the content of the state files is thus fragile and unsupported, and projects doing this are recommended to consider\nmoving to podresources API or to other supported APIs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overview-of-the-api\">Overview of the API</h2>\n<p>The podresources API was <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/#monitoring-device-plugin-resources\">initially proposed to enable device monitoring</a>.\nIn order to enable monitoring agents, a key prerequisite is to enable introspection of device assignment, which is performed by the kubelet.\nServing this purpose was the initial goal of the API. The first iteration of the API only had a single function implemented, <code>List</code>,\nto return information about the assignment of devices to containers.\nThe API is used by <a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni\">multus CNI</a> and by\n<a href=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter\">GPU monitoring tools</a>.</p>\n<p>Since its inception, the podresources API increased its scope to cover other resource managers than device manager.\nStarting from Kubernetes 1.20, the <code>List</code> API reports also CPU cores and memory regions (including hugepages); the API also\nreports the NUMA locality of the devices, while the locality of CPUs and memory can be inferred from the system.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes 1.21, the API <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/2403-pod-resources-allocatable-resources/README.md\">gained</a>\nthe <code>GetAllocatableResources</code> function.\nThis newer API complements the existing <code>List</code> API and enables monitoring agents to determine the unallocated resources,\nthus enabling new features built on top of the podresources API like a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/blob/master/pkg/noderesourcetopology/README.md\">NUMA-aware scheduler plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, in Kubernetes 1.27, another function, <code>Get</code> was introduced to be more friendly with CNI meta-plugins, to make it simpler to access resources\nallocated to a specific pod, rather than having to filter through resources for all pods on the node. The <code>Get</code> function is currently alpha level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consuming-the-api\">Consuming the API</h2>\n<p>The podresources API is served by the kubelet locally, on the same node on which is running.\nOn unix flavors, the endpoint is served over a unix domain socket; the default path is <code>/var/lib/kubelet/pod-resources/kubelet.sock</code>.\nOn windows, the endpoint is served over a named pipe; the default path is <code>npipe://\\\\.\\pipe\\kubelet-pod-resources</code>.</p>\n<p>In order for the containerized monitoring application consume the API, the socket should be mounted inside the container.\nA good practice is to mount the directory on which the podresources socket endpoint sits rather than the socket directly.\nThis will ensure that after a kubelet restart, the containerized monitor application will be able to re-connect to the socket.</p>\n<p>An example manifest for a hypothetical monitoring agent consuming the podresources API and deployed as a DaemonSet could look like:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"><span

straightforward to consume the podresources API programmatically.\nThe kubelet API package provides the protocol file and the go type definitions; however, a client package is not yet available from the project,\nand the existing code should not be used directly.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.28.0-rc.0/pkg/kubelet/apis/podresources/client.go#L32\">recommended</a>\napproach is to reimplement the client in your projects, copying and pasting the related functions like for example\nthe multus project is <a href=\"https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/blob/v4.0.2/pkg/kubeletclient/kubeletclient.go\">doing</a>.</p>\n<p>When operating the containerized monitoring application consuming the podresources API, few points are worth highlighting to prevent &quot;gotcha&quot; moments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even though the API only exposes data, and doesn't allow by design clients to mutate the kubelet state, the gRPC request/response model requires\nread-write access to the podresources API socket. In other words, it is not possible to limit the container mount to <code>ReadOnly</code>.</li>\n<li>Multiple clients are allowed to connect to the podresources socket and consume the API, since it is stateless.</li>\n<li>The kubelet has <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116459\">built-in rate limits</a> to mitigate local Denial of Service attacks from\nmisbehaving or malicious consumers. The consumers of the API must tolerate rate limit errors returned by the server. The rate limit is currently\nhardcoded and global, so misbehaving clients can consume all the quota and potentially starve correctly behaving clients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"future-enhancements\">Future enhancements</h2>\n<p>For historical reasons, the podresources API has a less precise specification than typical kubernetes APIs (such as the Kubernetes HTTP API, or the container runtime interface).\nThis leads to unspecified behavior in corner cases.\nAn <a href=\"https://issues.k8s.io/119423\">effort</a> is ongoing to rectify this state and to have a more precise specification.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3063-dynamic-resource-allocation\">Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)</a> infrastructure\nis a major overhaul of the resource management.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/3695-pod-resources-for-dra\">integration</a> with the podresources API\nis already ongoing.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://issues.k8s.io/119817\">effort</a> is ongoing to recommend or create a reference client package ready to be consumed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p>This feature is driven by <a href=\"https://github.com/Kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-node/README.md\">SIG Node</a>.\nPlease join us to connect with the community and share your ideas and feedback around the above feature and\nbeyond.

Meanwhile, security teams often don’t have the context they need to understand resource behavior and ownership, identify the highest-priority vulnerabilities in the environment, and communicate the necessary changes to developers.","PublishedAt":"2023-08-22 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/csm-at-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4422,"Title":"Visualize team and application boundaries in the Service Map","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/service-map-team-application-boundaries/service-map-team-app-boundary-visualization-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>The complexity of microservice architectures can make it hard to determine where an application&rsquo;s dependencies begin and end and who manages which ones. This can pose a variety of challenges both in the course of day-to-day operations and during incidents. Lacking a clear picture of the ownership and interplay of your services can impede accountability and cause application development, incident investigations, and onboarding processes to become prolonged and haphazard.To prevent these difficulties, the Datadog Service Map now allows you to visualize team and application boundaries among your services.","PublishedAt":"2023-08-22 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/service-map-team-application-boundaries/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":4436,"Title":"How to get actionable insights from your data","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-08-22 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-get-actionable-insights-from-your-data","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4408,"Title":"HashiCorp updates licensing FAQ based on community questions","Description":"HashiCorp continues to update our licensing FAQ based on questions from the community about our change to the Business Source License for future releases of HashiCorp products.","PublishedAt":"2023-08-21 20:15:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-updates-licensing-faq-based-on-community-questions","SourceName":"HashiCorp"}},{"node":{"ID":4405,"Title":"AWS Weekly Roundup – AWS AppSync, AWS CodePipeline, Events and More – August 21, 2023","Description":"In a few days, I will board a plane towards the south.

By default, kubeadm runs\na local etcd instance on each control plane node.</p>\n<p>In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate <code>EtcdLearnerMode</code>. With this feature gate enabled,\nwhen joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and\npromoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-advantages-of-using-etcd-learner-mode\">What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?</h2>\n<p>etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption\nin Kubernetes clusters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Resilience</strong>: etcd learner nodes are non-voting members that catch up with\nthe leader's logs before becoming fully operational. This prevents new cluster members\nfrom disrupting the quorum or causing leader elections, making the cluster more resilient\nduring membership changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Cluster Unavailability</strong>: Traditional approaches to adding new members often\nresult in cluster unavailability periods, especially in slow infrastructure or misconfigurations.\netcd learner mode minimizes such disruptions.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplified Maintenance</strong>: Learner nodes provide a safer and reversible way to add or replace\ncluster members. This reduces the risk of accidental cluster outages due to misconfigurations or\nmissteps during member additions.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Network Tolerance</strong>: In scenarios involving network partitions, learner mode allows\nfor more graceful handling. Depending on the partition a new member lands, it can seamlessly\nintegrate with the existing cluster without causing disruptions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, the etcd learner mode improves the reliability and manageability of Kubernetes clusters\nduring member additions and changes, making it a valuable feature for cluster operators.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-nodes-join-a-cluster-that-s-using-the-new-mode\">How nodes join a cluster that's using the new mode</h2>\n<h3 id=\"create-K8s-cluster-etcd-learner-mode\">Create a Kubernetes cluster backed by etcd in learner mode</h3>\n<p>For a general explanation about creating highly available clusters with kubeadm, you can refer to\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/\">Creating Highly Available Clusters with kubeadm</a>.</p>\n<p>To create a Kubernetes cluster, backed by etcd in learner mode, using kubeadm, follow these steps:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#080;font-style:italic\"># kubeadm init --feature-gates=EtcdLearnerMode=true ...</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>kubeadm init --config<span style=\"color:#666\">=</span>kubeadm-config.yaml\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The kubeadm configuration file is like below:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>ClusterConfiguration<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">featureGates</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">EtcdLearnerMode</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#a2f;font-weight:bold\">true</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The kubeadm tool deploys a single-node Kubernetes cluster with etcd set to use learner mode.</p>\n<h3 id=\"join-nodes-to-the-kubernetes-cluster\">Join nodes to the Kubernetes cluster</h3>\n<p>Before joining a control-plane node to the new Kubernetes cluster, ensure that the existing control plane nodes\nand all etcd members are healthy.</p>\n<p>Check the cluster health with <code>etcdctl</code>.

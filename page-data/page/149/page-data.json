This means that the ability to build reliable, highly-performant APIs—and govern their behavior and performance—is more important than ever.

Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes and one major removal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-kubernetes-api-removal-and-deprecation-process\">The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process</h2>\n<p>The Kubernetes project has a well-documented <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/\">deprecation policy</a> for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.</li>\n<li>Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after deprecation.</li>\n<li>Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the documentation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-about-podsecuritypolicy\">A Note About PodSecurityPolicy</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.25, we will be removing PodSecurityPolicy <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/\">after its deprecation in v1.21</a>. PodSecurityPolicy has served us honorably, but its complex and often confusing usage necessitated changes, which unfortunately would have been breaking changes. To address this, it is being removed in favor of a replacement, Pod Security Admission, which is graduating to stable in this release as well. If you are currently relying on PodSecurityPolicy, follow the instructions for <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/migrate-from-psp/\">migration to Pod Security Admission</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"major-changes-for-kubernetes-v1-25\">Major Changes for Kubernetes v1.25</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes, in addition to the removal of PodSecurityPolicy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"csi-migration-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-625\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/625\">CSI Migration</a></h3>\n<p>The effort to move the in-tree volume plugins to out-of-tree CSI drivers continues, with the core CSI Migration feature going GA in v1.25. This is an important step towards removing the in-tree volume plugins entirely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"volume-plugin-deprecations-and-removals\">Volume Plugin Deprecations and Removals</h3>\n<p>Several volume are being deprecated or removed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3446\">GlusterFS will be deprecated in v1.25</a>. While a CSI driver was built for it, it has not been maintained. The possibility of migration to a compatible CSI driver <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/100897\">was discussed</a>, but a decision was ultimately made to begin the deprecation of the GlusterFS plugin from in-tree drivers. The <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2589\">Portworx in-tree volume plugin</a> is also being deprecated with this release. The Flocker, Quobyte, and StorageOS in-tree volume plugins are being removed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"declare-unsupported-vsphere-versions-https-github-com-kubernetes-kubernetes-pull-111255\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111255\">Declare Unsupported vSphere Versions</a></h3>\n<p>From Kubernetes v1.25, the in-tree vSphere volume driver will not support any vSphere release before 7.0u2. Check the v1.25 detailed release notes for more advice on how to handle this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"signing-release-artifacts-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-3031\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031\">Signing Release Artifacts</a></h3>\n<p>An additional step in improving the security posture of the release process, the signing of Kubernetes release artifacts will graduate to Beta in this release. This is in line with the proposed enhancement of targeting SLSA Level 3 compliance for the Kubernetes release process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"support-for-cgroup-v2-graduating-to-stable-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-2254\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2254\">Support for cgroup v2 Graduating to Stable</a></h3>\n<p>The new kernel cgroups v2 API was declared stable more than two years ago, and in this release we're taking solid steps towards full adoption of it. While cgroup v1 will continue to be supported, this change makes us ready to deal with the eventual deprecation of cgroup v1 and its replacement by cgroup v2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cleaning-up-iptables-chain-ownership-https-github-com-kubernetes-enhancements-issues-3178\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3178\">Cleaning up IPTables Chain Ownership</a></h3>\n<p>From the Kubernetes 1.25 release, the iptables chains created by Kubernetes will only support for internal Kubernetes use cases.

The efforts for Hindi\nlocalization are currently being spearheaded by students in India.</p>\n<p>In addition to that, there are two other subprojects: <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/reference-docs\">reference-docs</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/website\">website</a>, which is built with Hugo and is an important ownership area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dockershim-removal\">Recently there has been a lot of buzz around the Kubernetes ecosystem as well as the industry regarding the removal of dockershim in the latest 1.24 release. How has SIG Docs helped the project to ensure a smooth change among the end-users?</h3>\n<p>Documenting the removal of Dockershim was a mammoth task, requiring the revamping of existing documentation\nand communicating to the various stakeholders regarding the deprecation efforts. It needed a community effort,\nso ahead of the 1.24 release, SIG Docs partnered with Docs and Comms verticals, the Release Lead from the\nRelease Team, and also the CNCF to help put the word out. Weekly meetings and a GitHub project board were\nset up to track progress, review issues and approve PRs and keep the Kubernetes website updated. This has\nalso helped new contributors know about the depreciation, so that if any good-first-issue pops up, they could chip in.\nA dedicated Slack channel was used to communicate meeting updates, invite feedback or to solicit help on\noutstanding issues and PRs. The weekly meeting also continued for a month after the 1.24 release to review related issues and fix them.\nA huge shoutout to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/celeste_horgan\">Celeste Horgan</a>, who kept the ball rolling on this\nconversation throughout the deprecation process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-should-new-and-existing-contributors-consider-joining-this-sig\">Why should new and existing contributors consider joining this SIG?</h3>\n<p>Kubernetes is a vast project and can be intimidating at first for a lot of folks to find a place to start.\nAny open source project is defined by its quality of documentation and SIG Docs aims to be a welcoming,\nhelpful place for new contributors to get onboard. One gets the perks of working with the project docs\nas well as learning by reading it. They can also bring their own, new perspective to create and improve\nthe documentation. In the long run if they stick to SIG Docs, they can rise up the ladder to be maintainers.\nThis will help make a big project like Kubernetes easier to parse and navigate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-you-help-new-contributors-get-started-are-there-any-prerequisites-to-join\">How do you help new contributors get started? Are there any prerequisites to join?</h3>\n<p>There are no such prerequisites to get started with contributing to Docs. But there is certainly a fantastic\nContribution to Docs guide which is always kept as updated and relevant as possible and new contributors\nare urged to read it and keep it handy. Also, there are a lot of useful pins and bookmarks in the\ncommunity Slack channel <a href=\"https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C1J0BPD2M\">#sig-docs</a>. GitHub issues with\nthe good-first-issue labels in the kubernetes/website repo is a great place to create your first PR.\nNow, SIG Docs has a monthly New Contributor Meet and Greet on the first Tuesday of the month with the\nfirst occupant of the New Contributor Ambassador role, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RinkiyaKeDad\">Arsh Sharma</a>.\nThis has helped in making a more accessible point of contact within the SIG for new contributors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"any-sig-related-accomplishment-that-you-re-really-proud-of\">Any SIG related accomplishment that you’re really proud of?</h3>\n<p><strong>DM &amp; RL</strong> : The formalization of the localization subproject in the last few months has been a big win\nfor SIG Docs, given all the great work put in by contributors from different countries. Earlier the\nlocalization efforts didn’t have any streamlined process and focus was given to provide a structure by\ndrafting a KEP over the past couple of months for localization to be formalized as a subproject, which\nis planned to be pushed through by the end of third quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>DM</strong> : Another area where there has been a lot of success is the New Contributor Ambassador role,\nwhich has helped in making a more accessible point of contact for the onboarding of new contributors into the project.</p>\n<p><strong>NV</strong> : For each release cycle, SIG Docs have to review release docs and feature blogs highlighting\nrelease updates within a short window. This is always a big effort for the docs and blogs reviewers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-there-something-exciting-coming-up-for-the-future-of-sig-docs-that-you-want-the-community-to-know\">Is there something exciting coming up for the future of SIG Docs that you want the community to know?</h3>\n<p>SIG Docs is now looking forward to establishing a roadmap, having a steady pipeline of folks being able\nto push improvements to the documentation and streamlining community involvement in triaging issues and\nreviewing PRs being filed. To build one such contributor and reviewership base, a mentorship program is\nbeing set up to help current contributors become reviewers. This definitely is a space to watch out for more!</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap Up</h2>\n<p>SIG Docs hosted a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDfcBF5et3Q\">deep dive talk</a>\nduring on KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021, covering their awesome SIG.\nThey are very welcoming and have been the starting ground into Kubernetes\nfor a lot of new folks who want to contribute to the project.\nJoin the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-docs/README.md\">SIG's meetings</a> to find out\nabout the most recent research results, their plans for the forthcoming year, and how to get involved in the upstream Docs team as a contributor!</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-08-02 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/02/sig-docs-spotlight-2022/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":30,"skip":4440,"numPages":193,"currentPage":149}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

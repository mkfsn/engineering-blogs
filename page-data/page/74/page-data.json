utilization of the <strong>Pods</strong>.</p>\n<p>In case a Pod has multiple containers, the utilization calculation would be:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>sum{the resource usage of each container} / sum{the resource request of each container}\n</code></pre><p>The resource utilization of each container may not have a direct correlation or may grow at different rates as the load changes.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A sidecar container is only providing an auxiliary service such as log shipping.\nIf the application does not log very frequently or does not produce logs in its hotpath\nthen the usage of the log shipper will not grow.</li>\n<li>A sidecar container which provides authentication. Due to heavy caching\nthe usage will only increase slightly when the load on the main container increases.\nIn the current blended usage calculation approach this usually results in\nthe HPA not scaling up the deployment because the blended usage is still low.</li>\n<li>A sidecar may be injected without resources set which prevents scaling\nbased on utilization. In the current logic the HPA controller can only scale\non absolute resource usage of the pod when the resource requests are not set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, in such case, if only one container's resource utilization goes high,\nthe Resource type metric may not suggest scaling up.</p>\n<p>So, for the accurate autoscaling, you may want to use the ContainerResource type metric for such Pods instead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-for-the-beta\">What's new for the beta?</h2>\n<p>For Kubernetes v1.27, the ContainerResource type metric is available by default as described at the beginning\nof this article.\n(You can still disable it by the <code>HPAContainerMetrics</code> feature gate.)</p>\n<p>Also, we've improved the observability of HPA controller by exposing some metrics from the kube-controller-manager:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>metric_computation_total</code>: Number of metric computations.</li>\n<li><code>metric_computation_duration_seconds</code>: The time that the HPA controller takes to calculate one metric.</li>\n<li><code>reconciliations_total</code>: Number of reconciliation of HPA controller.</li>\n<li><code>reconciliation_duration_seconds</code>: The time that the HPA controller takes to reconcile a HPA object once.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These metrics have labels <code>action</code> (<code>scale_up</code>, <code>scale_down</code>, <code>none</code>) and <code>error</code> (<code>spec</code>, <code>internal</code>, <code>none</code>).\nAnd, in addition to them, the first two metrics have the <code>metric_type</code> label\nwhich corresponds to <code>.spec.metrics[*].type</code> for a HorizontalPodAutoscaler.</p>\n<p>All metrics are useful for general monitoring of HPA controller,\nyou can get deeper insight into which part has a problem, where it takes time, how much scaling tends to happen at which time on your cluster etc.</p>\n<p>Another minor stuff, we've changed the <code>SuccessfulRescale</code> event's messages\nso that everyone can check whether the events came from the resource metric or\nthe container resource metric (See <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116045\">the related PR</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-involved\">Getting involved</h2>\n<p>This feature is managed by <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling\">SIG Autoscaling</a>.\nPlease join us and share your feedback.

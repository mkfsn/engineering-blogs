This is a common issue that\ncluster administrators may face.</p>\n<p>This blog post focuses on methods to speed up pod start-up from the kubelet side. It does not\ninvolve the creation time of pods by controller-manager through kube-apiserver, nor does it\ninclude scheduling time for pods or webhooks executed on it.</p>\n<p>We have mentioned some important factors here to consider from the kubelet's perspective, but\nthis is not an exhaustive list. As Kubernetes v1.27 is released, this blog highlights\nsignificant changes in v1.27 that aid in speeding up pod start-up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"parallel-container-image-pulls\">Parallel container image pulls</h2>\n<p>Pulling images always takes some time and what's worse is that image pulls are done serially by\ndefault. In other words, kubelet will send only one image pull request to the image service at\na time. Other image pull requests have to wait until the one being processed is complete.</p>\n<p>To enable parallel image pulls, set the <code>serializeImagePulls</code> field to false in the kubelet\nconfiguration. When <code>serializeImagePulls</code> is disabled, requests for image pulls are immediately\nsent to the image service and multiple images can be pulled concurrently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximum-parallel-image-pulls-will-help-secure-your-node-from-overloading-on-image-pulling\">Maximum parallel image pulls will help secure your node from overloading on image pulling</h3>\n<p>We introduced a new feature in kubelet that sets a limit on the number of parallel image\npulls at the node level. This limit restricts the maximum number of images that can be pulled\nsimultaneously. If there is an image pull request beyond this limit, it will be blocked until\none of the ongoing image pulls finishes. Before enabling this feature, please ensure that your\ncontainer runtime's image service can handle parallel image pulls effectively.</p>\n<p>To limit the number of simultaneous image pulls, you can configure the <code>maxParallelImagePulls</code>\nfield in kubelet. By setting <code>maxParallelImagePulls</code> to a value of <em>n</em>, only <em>n</em> images will\nbe pulled concurrently. Any additional image pulls beyond this limit will wait until at least\none ongoing pull is complete.</p>\n<p>You can find more details in the associated KEP: <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3673\">Kubelet limit of Parallel Image Pulls</a>\n(KEP-3673).</p>\n<h2 id=\"raised-default-api-query-per-second-limits-for-kubelet\">Raised default API query-per-second limits for kubelet</h2>\n<p>To improve pod startup in scenarios with multiple pods on a node, particularly sudden scaling\nsituations, it is necessary for Kubelet to synchronize the pod status and prepare configmaps,\nsecrets, or volumes. This requires a large bandwidth to access kube-apiserver.</p>\n<p>In versions prior to v1.27, the default <code>kubeAPIQPS</code> was 5 and <code>kubeAPIBurst</code> was 10. However,\nthe kubelet in v1.27 has increased these defaults to 50 and 100 respectively for better performance during\npod startup. It's worth noting that this isn't the only reason why we've bumped up the API QPS\nlimits for Kubelet.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It has a potential to be hugely throttled now (default QPS = 5)</li>\n<li>In large clusters they can generate significant load anyway as there are a lot of them</li>\n<li>They have a dedicated PriorityLevel and FlowSchema that we can easily control</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Previously, we often encountered <code>volume mount timeout</code> on kubelet in node with more than 50 pods\nduring pod start up. We suggest that cluster operators bump <code>kubeAPIQPS</code> to 20 and <code>kubeAPIBurst</code> to 40,\nespecially if using bare metal nodes.</p>\n<p>More detials can be found in the KEP <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1040\">https://kep.k8s.io/1040</a> and the pull request <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/116121\">#116121</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"event-triggered-updates-to-container-status\">Event triggered updates to container status</h2>\n<p><code>Evented PLEG</code> (PLEG is short for &quot;Pod Lifecycle Event Generator&quot;) is set to be in beta for v1.27,\nKubernetes offers two ways for the kubelet to detect Pod lifecycle events, such as a the last\nprocess in a container shutting down.\nIn Kubernetes v1.27, the <em>event based</em> mechanism has graduated to beta but remains\ndisabled by default. If you do explicitly switch to event-based lifecycle change detection,\nthe kubelet is able to start Pods more quickly than with the default approach that relies on polling.\nThe default mechanism, polling for lifecycle changes, adds a noticeable overhead; this affects\nthe kubelet's ability to handle different tasks in parallel, and leads to poor performance and\nreliability issues. For these reasons, we recommend that you switch your nodes to use\nevent-based pod lifecycle change detection.</p>\n<p>Further details can be found in the KEP <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/3386\">https://kep.k8s.io/3386</a> and\n<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/switch-to-evented-pleg/\">Switching From Polling to CRI Event-based Updates to Container Status</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"raise-your-pod-resource-limit-if-needed\">Raise your pod resource limit if needed</h2>\n<p>During start-up, some pods may consume a considerable amount of CPU or memory. If the CPU limit is\nlow, this can significantly slow down the pod start-up process. To improve the memory management,\nKubernetes v1.22 introduced a feature gate called MemoryQoS to kubelet. This feature enables\nkubelet to set memory QoS at container, pod, and QoS levels for better protection and guaranteed\nquality of memory when running with cgroups v2. Although it has benefits, it is possible that\nenabling this feature gate may affect the start-up speed of the pod if the pod startup consumes\na large amount of memory.</p>\n<p>Kubelet configuration now includes <code>memoryThrottlingFactor</code>. This factor is multiplied by\nthe memory limit or node allocatable memory to set the cgroupv2 memory.high value for enforcing\nMemoryQoS. Decreasing this factor sets a lower high limit for container cgroups, increasing reclaim\npressure. Increasing this factor will put less reclaim pressure. The default value is 0.8 initially\nand will change to 0.9 in Kubernetes v1.27. This parameter adjustment can reduce the potential\nimpact of this feature on pod startup speed.</p>\n<p>Further details can be found in the KEP <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/2570\">https://kep.k8s.io/2570</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-more\">What's more?</h2>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.26, a new histogram metric <code>pod_start_sli_duration_seconds</code> was added for Pod\nstartup latency SLI/SLO details. Additionally, the kubelet log will now display more information\nabout pod start-related timestamps, as shown below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dec 30 15:33:13.375379 e2e-022435249c-674b9-minion-group-gdj4 kubelet[8362]: I1230 15:33:13.375359 8362 pod_startup_latency_tracker.go:102] &quot;Observed pod startup duration&quot; pod=&quot;kube-system/konnectivity-agent-gnc9k&quot; podStartSLOduration=-9.223372029479458e+09 pod.CreationTimestamp=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:06 +0000 UTC&quot; firstStartedPulling=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:09.258791695 +0000 UTC m=+13.029631711&quot; lastFinishedPulling=&quot;0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC&quot; observedRunningTime=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:13.375009262 +0000 UTC m=+17.145849275&quot; watchObservedRunningTime=&quot;2022-12-30 15:33:13.375317944 +0000 UTC m=+17.146157970&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The SELinux Relabeling with Mount Options feature moved to Beta in v1.27. This feature speeds up\ncontainer startup by mounting volumes with the correct SELinux label instead of changing each file\non the volumes recursively. Further details can be found in the KEP <a href=\"https://kep.k8s.io/1710\">https://kep.k8s.io/1710</a>.</p>\n<p>To identify the cause of slow pod startup, analyzing metrics and logs can be helpful. Other\nfactorsthat may impact pod startup include container runtime, disk speed, CPU and memory\nresources on the node.</p>\n<p>SIG Node is responsible for ensuring fast Pod startup times, while addressing issues in large\nclusters falls under the purview of SIG Scalability as well.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-05-15 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/15/speed-up-pod-startup/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":3673,"Title":"ChatGPT and Elasticsearch: A plugin to use ChatGPT with your Elastic data","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-05-15 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/chatgpt-elasticsearch-plugin-elastic-data","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":3663,"Title":"Batteries included: how AI will transform the who and how of programming","Description":"The recent arrival of LLMs capable of assisting programmers in writing, debugging and modifying code is yet another step.

This has been a disruptive operation for running\nworkloads... until now.</p>\n<p>In Kubernetes v1.27, we have added a new alpha feature that allows users\nto resize CPU/memory resources allocated to pods without restarting the\ncontainers. To facilitate this, the <code>resources</code> field in a pod's containers\nnow allow mutation for <code>cpu</code> and <code>memory</code> resources. They can be changed\nsimply by patching the running pod spec.</p>\n<p>This also means that <code>resources</code> field in the pod spec can no longer be\nrelied upon as an indicator of the pod's actual resources. Monitoring tools\nand other such applications must now look at new fields in the pod's status.\nKubernetes queries the actual CPU and memory requests and limits enforced on\nthe running containers via a CRI (Container Runtime Interface) API call to the\nruntime, such as containerd, which is responsible for running the containers.\nThe response from container runtime is reflected in the pod's status.</p>\n<p>In addition, a new <code>restartPolicy</code> for resize has been added. It gives users\ncontrol over how their containers are handled when resources are resized.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-s-new-in-v1-27\">What's new in v1.27?</h2>\n<p>Besides the addition of resize policy in the pod's spec, a new field named\n<code>allocatedResources</code> has been added to <code>containerStatuses</code> in the pod's status.\nThis field reflects the node resources allocated to the pod's containers.</p>\n<p>In addition, a new field called <code>resources</code> has been added to the container's\nstatus. This field reflects the actual resource requests and limits configured\non the running containers as reported by the container runtime.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a new field named <code>resize</code> has been added to the pod's status to show the\nstatus of the last requested resize. A value of <code>Proposed</code> is an acknowledgement\nof the requested resize and indicates that request was validated and recorded. A\nvalue of <code>InProgress</code> indicates that the node has accepted the resize request\nand is in the process of applying the resize request to the pod's containers.\nA value of <code>Deferred</code> means that the requested resize cannot be granted at this\ntime, and the node will keep retrying. The resize may be granted when other pods\nleave and free up node resources. A value of <code>Infeasible</code> is a signal that the\nnode cannot accommodate the requested resize. This can happen if the requested\nresize exceeds the maximum resources the node can ever allocate for a pod.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-to-use-this-feature\">When to use this feature</h2>\n<p>Here are a few examples where this feature may be useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pod is running on node but with either too much or too little resources.</li>\n<li>Pods are not being scheduled do to lack of sufficient CPU or memory in a\ncluster that is underutilized by running pods that were overprovisioned.</li>\n<li>Evicting certain stateful pods that need more resources to schedule them\non bigger nodes is an expensive or disruptive operation when other lower\npriority pods in the node can be resized down or moved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-this-feature\">How to use this feature</h2>\n<p>In order to use this feature in v1.27, the <code>InPlacePodVerticalScaling</code>\nfeature gate must be enabled. A local cluster with this feature enabled\ncan be started as shown below:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>root@vbuild:~/go/src/k8s.io/kubernetes# FEATURE_GATES=InPlacePodVerticalScaling=true ./hack/local-up-cluster.sh\ngo version go1.20.2 linux/arm64\n+++ [0320 13:52:02] Building go targets for linux/arm64\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubectl (static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-apiserver (static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kube-controller-manager (static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/cloud-controller-manager (non-static)\nk8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubelet (non-static)\n...\n...\nLogs:\n/tmp/etcd.log\n/tmp/kube-apiserver.log\n/tmp/kube-controller-manager.log\n/tmp/kube-proxy.log\n/tmp/kube-scheduler.log\n/tmp/kubelet.log\nTo start using your cluster, you can open up another terminal/tab and run:\nexport KUBECONFIG=/var/run/kubernetes/admin.kubeconfig\ncluster/kubectl.sh\nAlternatively, you can write to the default kubeconfig:\nexport KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=local\ncluster/kubectl.sh config set-cluster local --server=https://localhost:6443 --certificate-authority=/var/run/kubernetes/server-ca.crt\ncluster/kubectl.sh config set-credentials myself --client-key=/var/run/kubernetes/client-admin.key --client-certificate=/var/run/kubernetes/client-admin.crt\ncluster/kubectl.sh config set-context local --cluster=local --user=myself\ncluster/kubectl.sh config use-context local\ncluster/kubectl.sh\n</code></pre><p>Once the local cluster is up and running, Kubernetes users can schedule pods\nwith resources, and resize the pods via kubectl.

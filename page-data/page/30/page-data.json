We start with the SIG\nArchitecture: Conformance subproject</em></p>\n<p>In this <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/README.md\">SIG\nArchitecture</a>\nspotlight, we talked with <a href=\"https://github.com/Riaankl\">Riaan\nKleinhans</a> (ii-Team), Lead for the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/README.md#conformance-definition-1\">Conformance\nsub-project</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sig-architecture-and-the-conformance-subproject\">About SIG Architecture and the Conformance subproject</h2>\n<p><strong>Frederico (FSM)</strong>: Hello Riaan, and welcome! For starters, tell us a\nbit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p><strong>Riaan Kleinhans (RK)</strong>: Hi! My name is Riaan Kleinhans and I live in\nSouth Africa. I am the Project manager for the <a href=\"ii.nz\">ii-Team</a> in New\nZealand. When I joined ii the plan was to move to New Zealand in April\n2020 and then Covid happened. Fortunately, being a flexible and\ndynamic team we were able to make it work remotely and in very\ndifferent time zones.</p>\n<p>The ii team have been tasked with managing the Kubernetes Conformance\ntesting technical debt and writing tests to clear the technical\ndebt. I stepped into the role of project manager to be the link\nbetween monitoring, test writing and the community. Through that work\nI had the privilege of meeting <a href=\"https://github.com/dankohn\">Dan Kohn</a>\nin those first months, his enthusiasm about the work we were doing was\na great inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Thank you - so, your involvement in SIG Architecture started\nbecause of the conformance work?</p>\n<p><strong>RK</strong>: SIG Architecture is the home for the Kubernetes Conformance\nsubproject. Initially, most of my interactions were directly with SIG\nArchitecture through the Conformance sub-project. However, as we\nbegan organizing the work by SIG, we started engaging directly with\neach individual SIG. These engagements with the SIGs that own the\nuntested APIs have helped us accelerate our work.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: How would you describe the main goals and\nareas of intervention of the Conformance sub-project?</p>\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: The Kubernetes Conformance sub-project focuses on guaranteeing\ncompatibility and adherence to the Kubernetes specification by\ndeveloping and maintaining a comprehensive conformance test suite. Its\nmain goals include assuring compatibility across different Kubernetes\nimplementations, verifying adherence to the API specification,\nsupporting the ecosystem by encouraging conformance certification, and\nfostering collaboration within the Kubernetes community. By providing\nstandardised tests and promoting consistent behaviour and\nfunctionality, the Conformance subproject ensures a reliable and\ncompatible Kubernetes ecosystem for developers and users alike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-on-the-conformance-test-suite\">More on the Conformance Test Suite</h2>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: A part of providing those standardised tests is, I believe,\nthe <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md\">Conformance Test\nSuite</a>. Could\nyou explain what it is and its importance?</p>\n<p><strong>RK</strong>: The Kubernetes Conformance Test Suite checks if Kubernetes\ndistributions meet the project's specifications, ensuring\ncompatibility across different implementations. It covers various\nfeatures like APIs, networking, storage, scheduling, and\nsecurity. Passing the tests confirms proper implementation and\npromotes a consistent and portable container orchestration platform.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Right, the tests are important in the way they define the\nminimum features that any Kubernetes cluster must support. Could you\ndescribe the process around determining which features are considered\nfor inclusion? Is there any tension between a more minimal approach,\nand proposals from the other SIGs?</p>\n<p><strong>RK</strong>: The requirements for each endpoint that undergoes conformance\ntesting are clearly defined by SIG Architecture. Only API endpoints\nthat are generally available and non-optional features are eligible\nfor conformance. Over the years, there have been several discussions\nregarding conformance profiles, exploring the possibility of including\noptional endpoints like RBAC, which are widely used by most end users,\nin specific profiles. However, this aspect is still a work in\nprogress.</p>\n<p>Endpoints that do not meet the conformance criteria are listed in\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/conformance/testdata/ineligible_endpoints.yaml\">ineligible_endpoints.yaml</a>,\nwhich is publicly accessible in the Kubernetes repo. This file can be\nupdated to add or remove endpoints as their status or requirements\nchange. These ineligible endpoints are also visible on\n<a href=\"https://apisnoop.cncf.io/\">APISnoop</a>.</p>\n<p>Ensuring transparency and incorporating community input regarding the\neligibility or ineligibility of endpoints is of utmost importance to\nSIG Architecture.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Writing tests for new features is something generally\nrequires some kind of enforcement. How do you see the evolution of\nthis in Kubernetes? Was there a specific effort to improve the process\nin a way that required tests would be a first-class citizen, or was\nthat never an issue?</p>\n<p><strong>RK</strong>: When discussions surrounding the Kubernetes conformance\nprogramme began in 2018, only approximately 11% of endpoints were\ncovered by tests. At that time, the CNCF's governing board requested\nthat if funding were to be provided for the work to cover missing\nconformance tests, the Kubernetes Community should adopt a policy of\nnot allowing new features to be added unless they include conformance\ntests for their stable APIs.</p>\n<p>SIG Architecture is responsible for stewarding this requirement, and\n<a href=\"https://apisnoop.cncf.io/\">APISnoop</a> has proven to be an invaluable\ntool in this regard. Through automation, APISnoop generates a pull\nrequest every weekend to highlight any discrepancies in Conformance\ncoverage. If any endpoints are promoted to General Availability\nwithout a conformance test, it will be promptly identified. This\napproach helps prevent the accumulation of new technical debt.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are plans in the near future to create a release\ninforming job, which will add an additional layer to prevent any new\ntechnical debt.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: I see, tooling and automation play an important role\nthere. What are, in your opinion, the areas that, conformance-wise,\nstill require some work to be done? In other words, what are the\ncurrent priority areas marked for improvement?</p>\n<p><strong>RK</strong>: We have reached the “100% Conformance Tested” milestone in\nrelease 1.27!</p>\n<p>At that point, the community took another look at all the endpoints\nthat were listed as ineligible for conformance. The list was populated\nthrough community input over several years. Several endpoints\nthat were previously deemed ineligible for conformance have been\nidentified and relocated to a new dedicated list, which is currently\nreceiving focused attention for conformance test development. Again,\nthat list can also be checked on apisnoop.cncf.io.</p>\n<p>To ensure the avoidance of new technical debt in the conformance\nproject, there are upcoming plans to establish a release informing job\nas an additional preventive measure.</p>\n<p>While APISnoop is currently hosted on CNCF infrastructure, the project\nhas been generously donated to the Kubernetes community. Consequently,\nit will be transferred to community-owned infrastructure before the\nend of 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: That's great news! For anyone wanting to help, what are the\nvenues for collaboration that you would highlight? Do all of them\nrequire solid knowledge of Kubernetes as a whole, or are there ways\nsomeone newer to the project can contribute?</p>\n<p><strong>RK</strong>: Contributing to conformance testing is akin to the task of\n&quot;washing the dishes&quot; – it may not be highly visible, but it remains\nincredibly important. It necessitates a strong understanding of\nKubernetes, particularly in the areas where the endpoints need to be\ntested. This is why working with each SIG that owns the API endpoint\nbeing tested is so important.</p>\n<p>As part of our commitment to making test writing accessible to\neveryone, the ii team is currently engaged in the development of a\n&quot;click and deploy&quot; solution. This solution aims to enable anyone to\nswiftly create a working environment on real hardware within\nminutes. We will share updates regarding this development as soon as\nwe are ready.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: That's very helpful, thank you. Any final comments you would\nlike to share with our readers?</p>\n<p><strong>RK</strong>: Conformance testing is a collaborative community endeavour that\ninvolves extensive cooperation among SIGs. SIG Architecture has\nspearheaded the initiative and provided guidance. However, the\nprogress of the work relies heavily on the support of all SIGs in\nreviewing, enhancing, and endorsing the tests.</p>\n<p>I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the ii team for\ntheir unwavering commitment to resolving technical debt over the\nyears. In particular, <a href=\"https://github.com/hh\">Hippie Hacker</a>'s\nguidance and stewardship of the vision has been\ninvaluable. Additionally, I want to give special recognition to\nStephen Heywood for shouldering the majority of the test writing\nworkload in recent releases, as well as to Zach Mandeville for his\ncontributions to APISnoop.</p>\n<p><strong>FSM</strong>: Many thanks for your availability and insightful comments,\nI've personally learned quite a bit with it and I'm sure our readers\nwill as well.</p>","PublishedAt":"2023-10-05 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/10/05/sig-architecture-conformance-spotlight-2023/","SourceName":"Kubernetes"}},{"node":{"ID":4760,"Title":"Improve your API test coverage with Datadog Synthetic Monitoring","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/api-test-coverage-monitoring-datadog-synthetics/api-test-hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>As your applications grow, your teams may be faced with managing a complex, expanding mesh of potentially thousands of loosely connected APIs—each one a new point of failure that can be difficult to track and patch.

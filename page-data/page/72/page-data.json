Clients can use the virtual IP address (or <em>VIP</em>) provided\nby the Service for access, and Kubernetes provides load balancing for traffic accessing\ndifferent back-end Pods, but a ClusterIP type of Service is limited to providing access to\nnodes within the cluster, while traffic from outside the cluster cannot be routed.\nOne way to solve this problem is to use a <code>type: NodePort</code> Service, which sets up a mapping\nto a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, thus redirecting traffic from the\noutside to the inside of the cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-kubernetes-allocates-node-ports-to-services\">How Kubernetes allocates node ports to Services?</h2>\n<p>When a <code>type: NodePort</code> Service is created, its corresponding port(s) are allocated in one\nof two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dynamic</strong> : If the Service type is <code>NodePort</code> and you do not set a <code>nodePort</code>\nvalue explicitly in the <code>spec</code> for that Service, the Kubernetes control plane will\nautomatically allocate an unused port to it at creation time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Static</strong> : In addition to the dynamic auto-assignment described above, you can also\nexplicitly assign a port that is within the nodeport port range configuration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The value of <code>nodePort</code> that you manually assign must be unique across the whole cluster.\nAttempting to create a Service of <code>type: NodePort</code> where you explicitly specify a node port that\nwas already allocated results in an error.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-you-need-to-reserve-ports-of-nodeport-service\">Why do you need to reserve ports of NodePort Service?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, you may want to have a NodePort Service running on well-known ports\nso that other components and users inside o r outside the cluster can use them.</p>\n<p>In some complex cluster deployments with a mix of Kubernetes nodes and other servers on the same network,\nit may be necessary to use some pre-defined ports for communication. In particular, some fundamental\ncomponents cannot rely on the VIPs that back <code>type: LoadBalancer</code> Services\nbecause the virtual IP address mapping implementation for that cluster also relies on\nthese foundational components.</p>\n<p>Now suppose you need to expose a Minio object storage service on Kubernetes to clients\nrunning outside the Kubernetes cluster, and the agreed port is <code>30009</code>, we need to\ncreate a Service as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-yaml\" data-lang=\"yaml\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">apiVersion</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>v1<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">kind</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>Service<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">metadata</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">name</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>minio<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"></span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">spec</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">ports</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>- <span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">name</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>api<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">nodePort</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#666\">30009</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">port</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#666\">9000</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">protocol</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>TCP<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">targetPort</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#666\">9000</span><span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">selector</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">app</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>minio<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span><span style=\"color:#008000;font-weight:bold\">type</span>:<span style=\"color:#bbb\"> </span>NodePort<span style=\"color:#bbb\">\n</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, as mentioned before, if the port (30009) required for the <code>minio</code> Service is not reserved,\nand another <code>type: NodePort</code> (or possibly <code>type: LoadBalancer</code>) Service is created and dynamically\nallocated before or concurrently with the <code>minio</code> Service, TCP port 30009 might be allocated to that\nother Service; if so, creation of the <code>minio</code> Service will fail due to a node port collision.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-can-you-avoid-nodeport-service-port-conflicts\">How can you avoid NodePort Service port conflicts?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes 1.24 introduced changes for <code>type: ClusterIP</code> Services, dividing the CIDR range for cluster\nIP addresses into two blocks that use different allocation policies to <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#avoiding-collisions\">reduce the risk of conflicts</a>.\nIn Kubernetes 1.27, as an alpha feature, you can adopt a similar policy for <code>type: NodePort</code> Services.\nYou can enable a new <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/\">feature gate</a>\n<code>ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange</code>. Turning this on allows you to use a different port allocation strategy\nfor <code>type: NodePort</code> Services, and reduce the risk of collision.</p>\n<p>The port range for <code>NodePort</code> will be divided, based on the formula <code>min(max(16, nodeport-size / 32), 128)</code>.\nThe outcome of the formula will be a number between 16 and 128, with a step size that increases as the\nsize of the nodeport range increases. The outcome of the formula determine that the size of static port\nrange. When the port range is less than 16, the size of static port range will be set to 0,\nwhich means that all ports will be dynamically allocated.</p>\n<p>Dynamic port assignment will use the upper band by default, once this has been exhausted it will use the lower range.\nThis will allow users to use static allocations on the lower band with a low risk of collision.</p>\n<h2

Instead, we chose to introduce Couchbase as a centralized storage tier [&#8230;]","PublishedAt":"2023-05-09 15:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/upscaling-profile-datastore-while-reducing-costs","SourceName":"Linkedin"}},{"node":{"ID":3616,"Title":"SoftBank Selects Cloudera Data Platform to Leverage Customer Intelligence While Ensuring Data Security","Description":"<p>Supporting Data Access to Achieve Data-Driven Innovation</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.cloudera.com/softbank-selects-cloudera-data-platform-to-leverage-customer-intelligence-while-ensuring-data-security/\">SoftBank Selects Cloudera Data Platform to Leverage Customer Intelligence While Ensuring Data Security</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blog.cloudera.com\">Cloudera Blog</a>.</p>\n","PublishedAt":"2023-05-09 13:34:44+00:00","OriginURL":"https://blog.cloudera.com/softbank-selects-cloudera-data-platform-to-leverage-customer-intelligence-while-ensuring-data-security/","SourceName":"Cloudera"}},{"node":{"ID":3660,"Title":"Snyk named to CNBC 2023 Disruptor 50 List","Description":"We are honored and humbled to announce Snyk has been named to the CNBC 2023 Disruptor 50 List, following our debut on the Disruptor List in 2021 and our listing as a Top Startup for the Enterprise in 2022.","PublishedAt":"2023-05-09 13:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-cnbc-2023-disruptor-50-list","SourceName":"Snyk"}},{"node":{"ID":3661,"Title":"Secure JavaScript URL validation","Description":"When developers need to handle URLs, we often turn to Java.

However, one challenge it presents is the deletion\nof resources that are no longer needed. In Kubernetes version 1.5, the <code>--prune</code> flag was\nintroduced to address this issue, allowing kubectl apply to automatically clean up previously\napplied resources removed from the current configuration.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that existing implementation of <code>--prune</code> has design flaws that diminish its\nperformance and can result in unexpected behaviors. The main issue stems from the lack of explicit\nencoding of the previously applied set by the preceding <code>apply</code> operation, necessitating\nerror-prone dynamic discovery. Object leakage, inadvertent over-selection of resources, and limited\ncompatibility with custom resources are a few notable drawbacks of this implementation. Moreover,\nits coupling to client-side apply hinders user upgrades to the superior server-side apply\nmechanism.</p>\n<p>Version 1.27 of <code>kubectl</code> introduces an alpha version of a revamped pruning implementation that\naddresses these issues. This new implementation, based on a concept called <em>ApplySet</em>, promises\nbetter performance and safety.</p>\n<p>An <em>ApplySet</em> is a group of resources associated with a <em>parent</em> object on the cluster, as\nidentified and configured through standardized labels and annotations. Additional standardized\nmetadata allows for accurate identification of ApplySet <em>member</em> objects within the cluster,\nsimplifying operations like pruning.</p>\n<p>To leverage ApplySet-based pruning, set the <code>KUBECTL_APPLYSET=true</code> environment variable and include\nthe flags <code>--prune</code> and <code>--applyset</code> in your <code>kubectl apply</code> invocation:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-shell\" data-lang=\"shell\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span><span style=\"color:#b8860b\">KUBECTL_APPLYSET</span><span style=\"color:#666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#a2f\">true</span> kubectl apply -f &lt;directory/&gt; --prune --applyset<span style=\"color:#666\">=</span>&lt;name&gt;\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By default, ApplySet uses a Secret as the parent object. However, you can also use\na ConfigMap with the format <code>--applyset=configmaps/&lt;name&gt;</code>. If your desired Secret or\nConfigMap object does not yet exist, <code>kubectl</code> will create it for you. Furthermore, custom\nresources can be enabled for use as ApplySet parent objects.</p>\n<p>The ApplySet implementation is based on a new low-level specification that can support higher-level\necosystem tools by improving their interoperability. The lightweight nature of this specification\nenables these tools to continue to use existing object grouping systems while opting in to\nApplySet's metadata conventions to prevent inadvertent changes by other tools (such as <code>kubectl</code>).</p>\n<p>ApplySet-based pruning offers a promising solution to the shortcomings of the previous <code>--prune</code>\nimplementation in <code>kubectl</code> and can help streamline your Kubernetes resource management.

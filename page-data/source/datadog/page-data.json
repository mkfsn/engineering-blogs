Without access to the inputs and associated states that caused the errors, reproducing them to find the root cause and a solution can be a lengthy and challenging process.To help you remediate bugs and discover their root causes faster, Datadog Exception Replay automatically captures the local variable data and execution context of production errors in APM Error Tracking.","PublishedAt":"2024-03-15 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/exception-replay-datadog/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":5769,"Title":"Integration roundup: Monitoring your container-native technologies","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/container-native-integrations/hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Container-native technologies increase the scalability and speed of deployment offered by containerized infrastructure, but they also present new monitoring challenges for organizations that adopt them.

But modern environments often rely on numerous APIs with complex dependency relationships, which makes it extremely difficult to gain complete API-level visibility and ensure that customer-facing services are functioning as expected.","PublishedAt":"2022-08-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-acquires-seekret/","SourceName":"Datadog"}},{"node":{"ID":1311,"Title":"Expedite infrastructure investigations with Kubernetes Anomalies","Description":"<img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual rss\" src=\"https://imgix.datadoghq.com/img/blog/monitor-kubernetes-anomalies/hero.png\" width=\"100%\"/>Modern Kubernetes environments are becoming increasingly complex.

As a CNI provider, Cilium extends the orchestrator&rsquo;s existing network capabilities by giving teams more control over how they build their applications and monitor traffic. For example, vanilla Kubernetes installations typically rely on traditional firewalls and Linux-based network utilities like iptables to filter pod-to-pod traffic by an IP address or port.

Our engineering leadership was well aware of the problem, and it was highlighted in our company’s quarterly goals and objectives as modularization. Faster build times means more productive developers. More productive developers are happier and can iterate on products more quickly. Modularization is key to decreasing build times, but avoiding work is another important part of the puzzle, and build caching is one way to avoid that work. Gradle, our tool for building Android, has a local file system cache that reuses outputs of previously performed tasks. We have been using the Gradle remote build cache in order to save our developers’ time. It helps us avoid redoing work that other teammates have already done or switching to old branches. However, to get the full benefits of caching, you have to go beyond simply setting it up.","PublishedAt":"2019-08-30 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/gradle-remote-build-cache-misses","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":818,"Title":"SoundCloud Is Playing the Oboe","Description":"Media and playback are at the core of SoundCloud’s experience.

Fulfilling a well-defined SLO is the very definition of meeting your users’ expectations. Conversely, a certain level of service errors is OK as long as you stay within the SLO — in other words, if the SLO grants you an error budget. Burning through this error budget too quickly is the ultimate signal that some rectifying action is needed. The faster the budget is burned, the more urgent it is that engineers get involved. This post describes how we implemented this concept at SoundCloud, enabling us to fulfill our SLOs without flooding our engineers on call with an unsustainable amount of pages.","PublishedAt":"2019-06-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/alerting-on-slos","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":820,"Title":"Playback on Web at SoundCloud","Description":"Maestro is a library we have developed to handle all playback across SoundCloud web applications.

Much has changed since then: the team has grown, the list of features has grown, and our audience has grown. Today, eight engineers are working full time on the official SoundCloud app, across various areas, with contributions pouring in from other parts of the organization. Due to the growing complexity and number of contributions, the app’s size has grown substantially. Currently the app consists of approximately 1200 Java source files, not counting tests, containing approximately 86000 lines of code. This doesn’t include native code, such as our playback or recording stacks. We’re not the first to run into Android’s limits in terms of build tools. An internal limitation of Dalvik’s byte code format (DEX), which I will explain in more detail, can leave you unable to build after your codebase reaches a certain size. If you fail to anticipate this, it might happen during the most inconvenient time, such as when you are preparing for a release. Part of our job in Core Engineering at SoundCloud is to make sure our developers are happy and productive; not being able to build our app anymore makes for neither happy nor productive developers. While there are a number of posts on this topic, I would like to describe in more detail what we have done to combat Android’s method limit, what things worked well and what didn’t work so well, what it actually means to use the  tool’s  switch and what you can do to improve application health with regards to size.","PublishedAt":"2015-09-21 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/congratulations-you-have-a-lot-of-code-remedying-androids-method-limit-part-1","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":865,"Title":"Introducing Rate Limits","Description":"At SoundCloud, we’re building an ecosystem where creativity thrives.

What we\nreally needed was a system with the following features: A multi-dimensional data model, so that data can be sliced and diced\nat will, along dimensions like instance, service, endpoint, and method. Operational simplicity, so that you can spin up a monitoring server\nwhere and when you want, even on your local workstation, without\nsetting up a distributed storage backend or reconfiguring the world. Scalable data collection and decentralized architecture, so that you\ncan reliably monitor the many instances of your services, and\nindependent teams can set up independent monitoring servers. Finally, a powerful query language that leverages the data model for\nmeaningful alerting (including easy silencing) and graphing (for\ndashboards and for ad-hoc exploration). All of these features existed in various systems. However, we could not\nidentify a system that combined them all until a colleague started an ambitious\npet project in 2012 that aimed to do so.

If you build an app or web service that generates any type of sound, it’s easy to connect it to SoundCloud and enable your users to share their creations across the web. Allowing users to share what they create to their existing social networks and the SoundCloud community brings great value in a variety of use cases. If you have an app for beat making, you can let your users post their creations to a dedicated group on SoundCloud. For aspiring music makers, it’s valuable and fun to get feedback from friends on Facebook. And for someone recording an interview with their phone, it’s super handy to be able to post the audio directly to a blog. In addition, a sharing feature is obviously practical for sending files to collaborators or moving audio between devices.","PublishedAt":"2011-04-05 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/sharing-sounds","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":958,"Title":"Hello developers!","Description":"We are happy to introduce you to our new developer portal developers.soundcloud.com.\n  Here we are bundling up all the SoundCloud platform…","PublishedAt":"2011-04-04 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/developers-soundcloud-com","SourceName":"Soundcloud"}},{"node":{"ID":959,"Title":"We ♥ OAuth 2","Description":"From today on, we advise developers to use OAuth 2 as preferred way of API authentication.

Elastic","Description":"<p><em>To log or not to log?</em> has always been a difficult question that software engineers still struggle with, to the detriment of site reliability engineering, or SRE, colleagues. Developers don't always get the level or context of the warnings and errors they capture in applications right and often log messages that may not always be helpful for SREs. I can admit to being one of those developers! This confusion often leads to a flood of events being ingested into logging platforms, making application monitoring and issue investigation for SREs feel a bit like this: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt79f8c650151adcf0/649c630d63cca619c8d295bd/i_love_lucy.gif\" alt=\"![I Love Lucy Conveyor Belt Gif](./images/1.gif)\" /></p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://giphy.com/explore/i-love-lucy-chocolate\">GIPHY</a></p>\n<p>When looking to reduce your log volume, it is possible to drop information on two dimensions: fields within an event, or the entire event itself. Removing dimensions of interest ensures we can focus on known events of interest and unknown events that may be of interest. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blteba8436b74285018/649c69b49c69d8ce93c1cf33/event_vs_field.jpeg\" alt=\"![Log event versus field](./images/event-vs-field.jpg)\" />\nIn this blog, we will discuss various approaches for dropping known irrelevant events and fields from logs via various collectors. Specifically we will focus on <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/logstash/\">Logstash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-overview.html\">Elastic Agent</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html\">Ingest Pipelines</a>, and filtering with <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/\">OpenTelemetry Collectors</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beats\">Beats</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/\">Beats</a> are a family of lightweight shippers that allows for the forwarding of events from a particular source. They are commonly used to ingest the events from a source into not just Elasticsearch, but also <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuring-output.html\">other outputs such as Logstash, Kafka, or Redis as shown in the Filebeat documentation</a>. There are six types of Beat available, which are summarized <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Our example will focus on Filebeat specifically, but both drop processors discussed here apply to all Beats. After following the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html\">quick start guide within the Filebeat documentation</a>, you will have a running process using configuration file <code>filebeat.yml</code> dictating which log files you are monitoring with Filebeat from <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-filebeat-options.html#filebeat-input-types\">any of the supported input types</a>. Hopefully your configuration specifies a series of inputs in a format similar to the below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\">filebeat.inputs:\n- type: filestream\n  id: my-logging-app\n  paths:\n    - /var/log/*.log\n</code></pre>\n<p>Filebeat has many options available to configure, of which a full listing is given in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-reference-yml.html\"><code>filebeat.reference.yml</code></a> in the documentation. However, it is the <code>drop_event</code> and <code>drop_fields</code> processors in particular that can help us exclude unhelpful messages and isolate only the relevant fields in a given event respectively.\n&nbsp;\nWhen using the <code>drop_event</code> processor, you need to make sure at least one <a href=\"(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/defining-processors.html#conditions\">condition</a>) is present to receive the messages you want; otherwise, if no condition is specified, the processor will drop all messages. If no condition is specified in the <code>drop_event</code> processor, all events will be dropped. Please ensure at least one condition is present to ensure you receive the messages you want. \nFor example, if we are not interested in HTTP requests against the <code>/profile</code> endpoint, we can amend the configuration to use the following condition:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\">filebeat.inputs:\n- type: filestream\n  id: my-logging-app\n  paths:\n    - /var/tmp/other.log\n    - /var/log/*.log\nprocessors:\n  - drop_event:\n      when:\n          and:\n            - equals:\n              url.scheme: http\n            - equals:\n              url.path: /profile\n</code></pre>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <code>drop_fields</code> processor will drop the specified fields, except for the <code>@timestamp</code> and <code>type</code> fields, if the specified condition is fulfilled. Similar to the <code>drop_event</code> processor, if the condition is missing then the fields will always be dropped. If we wanted to exclude the error message field for successful HTTP requests, we could configure a processor similar to the below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\">filebeat.inputs:\n- type: filestream\n  id: my-logging-app\n  paths:\n    - /var/tmp/other.log\n    - /var/log/*.log\nprocessors:\n  - drop_fields:\n      when:\n          and:\n            - equals:\n              url.scheme: http\n            - equals:\n              http.response.status_code: 200\n          fields: [\"event.message\"]\n          ignore_missing: false\n</code></pre>\n<p>When dropping fields, there is always a possibility that the field might not exist on a given log message. If the field does not exist in all events being processed in Filebeat, an error will be raised if <code>ignore_missing</code> is specified as <code>true</code> rather than the default value of <code>false</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"logstashfiltering\">Logstash filtering</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/logstash/\">Logstash</a> is a free and open data processing pipeline tool that allows you to ingest, transform, and output data between a myriad of sources. It sits within the Extract, Transform, and Load (or ETL) domain. With the prior discussion of Beats, it's important to note that usage of Logstash over Beats would be recommended if you want to centralize the transformation logic. Meanwhile, Beats or Elastic Agent allow dropping events early, which can reduce network traffic requirements early. \nLogstash provides a variety of transformation plugins out of the box that can be used to format and transform events from any source that Logstash is connected to. A typical pipeline within the Logstash configuration file <code>logstash.yml</code> contains three main sections: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>input</code> denotes the source of data to the pipeline.</li>\n<li><code>filter</code> contains the relevant data transformation logic.</li>\n<li>The target for the transformed data is configured in the <code>output</code> attribute.\nTo prevent events from making it to the output, the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-drop.html\">drop filter plugin will drop any events that meet the stated condition</a>. A typical example of reading from an input file, dropping INFO level events, and outputting to Elasticsearch is as follows:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\">input {\n  file {\n    id =&gt; \"my-logging-app\"\n    path =&gt; [ \"/var/tmp/other.log\", \"/var/log/*.log\" ]\n  }\n}\nfilter {\n  if [url.scheme] == \"http\" &amp;&amp; [url.path] == \"/profile\" {\n    drop {\n      percentage =&gt; 80\n    }\n  }\n}\noutput {\n  elasticsearch {\n        hosts =&gt; \"https://my-elasticsearch:9200\"\n        data_stream =&gt; \"true\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>One of the lesser-known options of this filter is the ability to configure a drop rate using the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-drop.html#plugins-filters-drop-percentage\"><code>percentage</code></a> option. One of the scary things about filtering out log events is the fear that you will inadvertently drop unknown but relevant entries that could be useful in an outage situation. Or, there is the possibility that your software sends a large volume of messages that could flood your instance, take up vital hot storage, and increase your costs. The percentage attribute covers this case by allowing a subset of the events to be ingested into Elasticsearch, which can address these challenges. In our example above, we ingest 20% of messages matching the criteria to Elasticsearch.\nSimilar to the <code>drop_fields</code> processor found in Beats, Logstash has a <code>remove_field</code> filter for removing individual fields. Although these can be used within many Logstash plugins, they are commonly used within the <code>mutate</code> plugin to transform events, similar to the below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\"># Input configuration omitted\nfilter {\n  if [url.scheme] == \"http\" &amp;&amp; [http.response.status_code] == 200 {\n    drop {\n      percentage =&gt; 80\n    }\n    mutate {\n      remove_field: [ \"event.message\" ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n# Output configuration omitted\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just like our Beats example, this will remove <code>event.message</code> from the events that are retained from the drop filter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"agent\">Agent</h2>\n<p>Elastic Agent is a single agent for logs, metrics, and security data that can execute on your host and send events from multiple services and infrastructure to Elasticsearch.\nSimilar to Beats, you can use the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/drop_event-processor.html\"><code>drop_event</code></a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/drop_fields-processor.html\"><code>drop_fields</code></a> processors in any integrations that support processors. For standalone installations, you should specify the processors within your <code>elastic-agent.yml</code> config. When using Fleet, the processing transforms are normally specified when configuring the integration under the <em>Advanced options</em> pop-out section, as shown below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltaf0b98692dc7f215/649c6d8befa20db5d04bd8ba/elastic-agent-kafka-processor.png\" alt=\"![Elastic Agent Kafka Integration Sample Processor](./images/elastic-agent-kafka-processor.png)\" /></p>\n<p>Comparing the above example with our Beats example, you'll notice they are using the same YAML-based format for both processors. There are some limitations to be aware of when using Elastic Agent processors, which are covered in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html#limitations\">Fleet documentation</a>. If you are unsure if processing data via Elastic Agent processors is the right thing for your use case, check out this <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html#processing-options\">handy matrix</a>.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"ingestpipelines\">Ingest pipelines</h2>\n<p>The Elastic Agent processors discussed in the previous section will process raw event data, meaning they execute before ingest pipelines. As a result, when using both approaches, proceed with caution as removing or altering fields expected by an ingest pipeline can cause the pipeline to break.\nAs covered in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html#create-manage-ingest-pipelines\">Create and manage pipeline documentation</a>, new pipelines can be created either within the <strong>Stack Management > Ingest Pipelines</strong> screen or via the <code>_ingest</code> API, which we will use.\nJust like the other tools covered in this piece, the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/drop-processor.html\"><code>drop</code> processor</a> will allow for any event that meets the required condition to be dropped. It's also the case that if no condition is specified, all events coming through will be dropped. What is different is that the conditional logic is written using <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/current/painless-guide.html\">Painless</a>, a Java-like scripting language, rather than the YAML syntax we have used previously:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\">PUT _ingest/pipeline/my-logging-app-pipeline\n{\n  \"description\": \"Event and field dropping for my-logging-app\",\n  \"processors\": [\n    {\n      \"drop\": {\n        \"description\" : \"Drop event\",\n        \"if\": \"ctx?.url?.scheme == 'http' &amp;&amp; ctx?.url?.path == '/profile'\",\n        \"ignore_failure\": true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"remove\": {\n        \"description\" : \"Drop field\",\n        \"field\" : \"event.message\",\n        \"if\": \"ctx?.url?.scheme == 'http' &amp;&amp; ctx?.http?.response?.status_code == 200\",\n        \"ignore_failure\": false\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/current/painless-ingest-processor-context.html\"><code>ctx</code> variable</a> is a map representation of the fields within the document coming through the pipeline, meaning our example will compare the values of the <code>url.scheme</code> and <code>http.response.status_code</code> fields. JavaScript developers will recognize the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/current/painless-operators-reference.html#null-safe-operator\"><code>?</code> denoted null safe operator</a>, which performs not null checks against the field access.\nAs visible in the second processor in the above example, the use of Painless conditional logic is also relevant to the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/remove-processor.html\"><code>remove</code> processor</a>. This processor will drop the specified fields from the event when they match the specified condition.\nOne of the capabilities that give ingest processors an edge over the other approaches is the ability to specify failure processors, either on the pipeline or a specified processor. Although Beat's does have an <code>ignore_missing</code> option as discussed previously, Ingest Processors allow us to add exception handling such as adding error messages to give details of the processor exception:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\">PUT _ingest/pipeline/my-logging-app-pipeline\n{\n  \"description\": \"Event and field dropping for my-logging-app with failures\",\n  \"processors\": [\n    {\n      \"drop\": {\n        \"description\" : \"Drop event\",\n        \"if\": \"ctx?.url?.scheme == 'http' &amp;&amp; ctx?.url?.path == '/profile'\",\n        \"ignore_failure\": true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"remove\": {\n        \"description\" : \"Drop field\",\n        \"field\" : \"event.message\",\n        \"if\": \"ctx?.url?.scheme == 'http' &amp;&amp; ctx?.http?.response?.status_code == 200\",\n        \"ignore_failure\": false\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"on_failure\": [\n    {\n      \"set\": {\n        \"description\": \"Set 'ingest.failure.message'\",\n        \"field\": \"ingest.failure.message\",\n        \"value\": \"Ingestion issue\"\n        }\n      }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The pipeline can then be used on a <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest.html#add-pipeline-to-indexing-request\">single indexing request</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest.html#set-default-pipeline\">set as the default pipeline</a> for an index, or even used alongside <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest.html#pipelines-for-beats\">Beats</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/ingest.html#pipelines-for-fleet-elastic-agent\">Elastic Agent</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opentelemetrycollectors\">OpenTelemetry collectors</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/transforming-telemetry/\">OpenTelemetry</a>, or OTel, is an open standard that provides APIs, tooling, and integrations to enable the capture of telemetry data such as logs, metrics, and traces from applications. Application developers commonly use the OpenTelemetry agent for their programming language of choice to send trace data and metrics directly to the Elastic Stack, as Elastic supports the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP).\nIn some cases, having every application send behavioral information directly to the observability platform may be unwise. Large enterprise ecosystems may have centralized observability capabilities or may run large microservice ecosystems where adopting a standard tracing practice can be difficult. However, the sanitization of events and traces is also challenging as the number of applications and services grows. These are the situations where using one or more collectors as a router of data to the Elastic Stack makes sense.\nAs demonstrated in the <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/\">OpenTelemetry documentation</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/open-telemetry-direct.html#connect-open-telemetry-collector\">example collector in the Elastic APM documentation</a>, the basic configuration for an OTel collector has four main sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>receivers</code> that define the sources of data, which can be push or pull-based.</li>\n<li><code>processors</code> that can filter or transform the received data before export, which is what we are interested in doing.</li>\n<li><code>exporters</code> which define how the data is sent to the final destination, in this case Elastic!</li>\n<li>A <code>service</code> section to define the components enabled in the collector that is needed for the other elements.\nDropping events and fields can be achieved using the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/filterprocessor\"><code>filter</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/attributesprocessor\"><code>attributes</code></a> processors, respectively, in the collector config. A selection of examples of both filters is shown below:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"yml language-yml\">receivers: \n  filelog:\n    include: [ /var/tmp/other.log, /var/log/*.log ]\nprocessors: \n  filter/denylist:\n    error_mode: ignore\n    logs:\n      log_record:\n        - 'url.scheme == \"info\"'\n        - 'url.path == \"/profile\"'\n        - 'http.response.status_code == 200'\n  attributes/errors:\n    actions:\n      - key: error.message\n        action: delete\n  memory_limiter:\n    check_interval: 1s\n    limit_mib: 2000\n  batch:\nexporters:\n  # Exporters configuration omitted \nservice:\n  pipelines:\n    # Pipelines configuration omitted\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>filter</code> processor applied to the telemetry type (logs, metrics, or traces) will drop the event if it matches any of the specified conditions. Meanwhile, the <code>attributes</code> processor applied to our error fields will delete the <code>error.message</code> attribute from all events. The <code>pattern</code> attribute can also be used in place of the <code>key</code> option to remove fields matching a specified regular expression. Field deletion based on conditions as we have done in our Beats, Logstash, and ingest pipeline examples is not part of the specification. However, an alternative would be to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/transformprocessor\"><code>transform</code> processor</a> to specify a complex transformation to set the value of a field and then delete. </p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p>The aim of the DevOps movement is to align the processes and practices of software engineering and SRE. That includes working together to ensure that relevant logs, metrics, and traces are sent from applications to our Observability platform.\nAs we have seen first-hand with <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/logstash/\">Logstash</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-overview.html\">Elastic Agent</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html\">Ingest Pipelines</a>, and <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/\">OTel collectors</a>, the approaches for dropping events and individual fields vary according to the tool used.\nYou may be wondering, which option is right for you? </p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the overhead of sending large messages over the network is a concern, transforming closer to the source using Beats or Logstash is the better option. If you're looking to minimize the system resources used in your collection and transformation, Beats may be preferred over Logstash as they have a small footprint.</li>\n<li>For centralizing transformation logic to apply to many application logs, using processors in an OTel collector may be the right approach.</li>\n<li>If you want to make use of centrally managed ingestion and transformation policies with popular services and systems such as Kafka, Nginx, or AWS, using Elastic Agent with Fleet is recommended.</li>\n<li>Ingest pipelines are great for transforming events at ingestion if you are less concerned about network overhead and would like your logic centralized within Elasticsearch. \nAlthough not covered here, other techniques such as runtime fields, index level compression, and <code>_synthetic_source</code> usage can also be used to reduce disk storage requirements and CPU overhead. If your favorite way to drop events or fields is not listed here, do let us know!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/beats/\">Elastic Beats</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filtering-and-enhancing-data.html\">Filebeat | Filter and enhance data with processors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/logstash/\">Logstash</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/filter-plugins.html\">Logstash | Filter plugins</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-overview.html\">Elastic Agent</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/elastic-agent-processor-configuration.html\">Elastic Agent | Processors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html\">Ingest Pipelines</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/processors.html\">Elaticsearch | Ingest processor reference</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/\">OTel Collectors</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/transforming-telemetry/#advanced-transformations\">OTel Transforming telemetry</a></li>\n</ol>","PublishedAt":"2023-07-03 13:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/pruning-incoming-log-volumes-with-elastic","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4082,"Title":"How to get the best of lexical and AI-powered search with Elastic’s vector database","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-07-03 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/lexical-ai-powered-search-elastic-vector-database","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4069,"Title":"The power of generative AI for retail and CPG","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-06-30 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/generative-ai-retail-cpg","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4071,"Title":"Improving the Elastic APM UI performance with continuous rollups and service metrics","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-06-30 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/improving-elastic-apm-ui-performance-continuous-rollups-service-metrics","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4072,"Title":"How we sped up data ingestion in Elasticsearch 8.6, 8.7, and 8.8","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-06-30 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/data-ingestion-elasticsearch","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4061,"Title":"Elastic Stack container images signed with Sigstore!","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2023-06-29 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-stack-container-images-signed-sigstore","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":4062,"Title":"Elastic Stack 8.8.2 released","Description":"<p>Version 8.8.2 of the Elastic Stack was released today.

APM as part of your Elastic Observability deployment","Description":"<p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">In a recent post, we showed you </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/getting-started-with-free-and-open-elastic-observability\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">how to get started with the free and open tier of Elastic Observability</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">. Below, we'll walk through what you need to do to expand your deployment so you can start gathering metrics from application performance monitoring (APM) or \"tracing\" data in your observability cluster, for free.</span></p><h2>What is APM?</h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Application performance monitoring lets you see where your applications spend their time, what they are doing, what other applications or services they are calling, and what errors or exceptions they are encountering.</span></p><p><img alt=\"distributed-trace.png\" src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4f2c901a48e81d2f/6090052af6a831100b5deb25/distributed-trace.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt4f2c901a48e81d2f\"/></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">In addition, APM also lets you see history and trends for key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as well as transaction and dependency information:</span></p><p><img alt=\"ruby-overview.png\" src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt0aee881105724120/609005407cc444103417ec49/ruby-overview.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt0aee881105724120\"/></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Whether you're setting up alerts for SLA breaches, trying to gauge the impact of your latest release, or deciding where to make the next improvement, APM can help with your root-cause analysis to help improve your users' experience and drive your mean time to resolution (MTTR) toward zero.</span></p><h2>Logical architecture</h2><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Elastic APM relies on the APM Integration inside Elastic Agent, which forwards application trace and metric data from applications instrumented with APM agents to an Elastic Observability cluster. Elastic APM supports multiple agent flavors:</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Native Elastic APM Agents, available for </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/index.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">multiple languages</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">, including Java, .NET, Go, Ruby, Python, Node.js,&nbsp; PHP, and client-side JavaScript</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Code instrumented with </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/open-telemetry-elastic.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">OpenTelemetry</span></a></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Code instrumented with </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/get-started/current/opentracing.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">OpenTracing</span></a></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Code instrumented with </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/jaeger.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Jaeger</span></a></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt530d9030ca5005ff/642f342ab2ef0d11ece9fa69/blog-elastic-observability-instrumented-services.png\" height=\"auto\"/></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">In this blog, we'll provide a quick example of how to instrument code with the native Elastic APM Python agent, but the overall steps are similar for other languages.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Please note that there is a strong distinction between the </span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Elastic APM Agent </strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">and the</span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"><strong> Elastic Agent</strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">. These are very different components, as you can see in the diagram above, so it’s important not to confuse them.</span></p><h2>Install the Elastic Agent</h2><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The first step is to install the Elastic Agent. You either need Fleet </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/add-a-fleet-server.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">installed first</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, or you can install the Elastic Agent standalone. Install the Elastic Agent somewhere by </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/master/elastic-agent-installation.html\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">following this guide</span></a><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This will give you an APM Integration endpoint you can hit.

This can be achieved either using the <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/dev_docs/tutorials/debugging.mdx\">Chrome DevTools debugging</a> or using Elastic APM Node.js Agent, which is built into Kibana for debugging purposes. Follow the steps to set up a locally running Kibana and APM configuration using the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/kibana-debugging.html#kibana-debugging\">Debugging Kibana section within the Developer guide</a>.\n&nbsp;\nFollowing these steps will set up a locally running Elasticsearch instance and APM server using Docker:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blta9212a064b903f0e/642c6e360c498f10e8dbcb20/running-docker-images.png\" alt=\"Local APM and Elasticsearch Instances\" /></p>\n<p>To ensure Kibana starts successfully, please ensure you check out branches from each repo that hold compatible Elasticsearch and Kibana versions, and that <code>kibana.dev.yml</code> configuration points to your locally running Elasticsearch cluster and APM server. Sample user credentials for Kibana including <code>admin</code> can be used to log in as outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/apm-integration-testing/blob/171f6ab86ec1ae88591658e315d332db73d3cc3f/README.md?plain=1#L50\">@elastic/apm-integration-testing readme</a>. Using the <code>yarn start</code> command on the Kibana repo will give you a running Kibana instance. \n&nbsp;\nIncluding the non-performance dashboard can be achieved by exporting the dashboard from the Saved Objects screen in Kibana and importing it into the locally running instance via the same screen. Be sure to export dependent objects so individual controls and indices are exported with the dashboard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltdf7a0a83046bc293/642d29c266181410a5732903/kibana-saved-objects-export-with-related-objects.png\" alt=\"kibana saved objects export with related onjects\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Accessing your dashboard locally will allow the APM Node.js Agent to capture any errors and traces in the dashboard navigation. You will see the <code>/dashboard</code> endpoint triggered to access your dashboard. APM will capture these requests in the <strong>kibana-frontend</strong> service.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltcfac9747f4d462c7/642d2a237ae71310d19e1ec4/kibana-debugging-dashboard-trace.png\" alt=\"kibana debugging dashboard trace\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Selecting this trace will present you with key trace information for your dashboard. A trace breakdown, as shown in the below screenshot, enabled you to scrutinize the execution time of your dashboard execution.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt8292f00d706859fa/642d2a7d0afb1c108e793398/kibana-frontend-dashboards-trace.png\" alt=\"kibana frontend dashboards trace\" /></p>\n<p>The breakdown will show the loading time and percentage proportion of the total execution time for JavaScript file loading, such as Kibana plugins, or response times for key Kibana API calls. This makes the APM information useful for identifying plugins slowing your dashboard down, particularly if you are making use of custom or community-developed plugins. It can also help find delays in key calls such as Kibana security. Or, via runtime fields on the APM indices, it can help answer usage questions such as which space is most used or which dashboard has the most page loads.</p>\n<p>A key limitation of using APM against Kibana is that captured traces only cover key calls for a given logical unit at a <code>page</code> level. From the <em>Metadata</em> tab, the label information shows that these traces are captured at a dashboard level and doesn't give information for each individual visualization as shown in the metadata for the trace depicted below. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt3fe6cb16179461f7/642d2add214c3211e18de672/kibana-dashboards-trace-metadata.png\" alt=\"![Kibana APM Trace Metadata](./images/kibana-dashboards-trace-metadata.png)\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"chromedevelopertools\">Chrome Developer Tools</h2>\n<p>With a locally running version of Kibana, you can also step through the code using Chrome Developer Tools. This is more useful in tracing errors or unexpected behavior in Kibana. After following the same local setup steps as used with Elastic APM, you need to start Kibana using Node inspect support, as per the <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/main/dev_docs/tutorials/debugging.mdx#debugging-using-chrome-devtools\">Kibana tutorial documentation</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"console language-console\">node --inspect-brk scripts/kibana\n</code></pre>\n<p>Navigating to <code>chrome://inspect</code> within the Chrome browser will allow you connect the native Node.js debugging tools to your running Kibana process:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltb8d2b4de2c2e2ca8/642d2bc6c6373410f683f940/chome-inspect.png\" alt=\"![Chrome Inspect](./images/chome-inspect.png)\" /></p>\n<p>Inspecting the Kibana process opens the DevTools, giving access to all the best loved developer tools such as the debugger. Setting breakpoints within the <code>bulk_resolve</code> POST method found in the APM traces allows you to capture the dashboard object. This call can also be examined using the Chrome DevTools <em>Network</em> tab. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbab62542ac664b9f/642d2c0b7ae71310d19e1ed9/kibana-node-debugging.png\" alt=\"![Chrome Inspect](./images/kibana-node-debugging.png)\" /></p>\n<p>Although the <code>VEGA_DEBUG.view</code> global variable gives us the ability to inspect the state of any Vega charts via Chrome Developer tools as outlined in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/vega.html#vega-browser-debugging-console\">documentation</a>, we need to be able to see the detail of other visualizations, too. The above screenshot shows the details of each panel in the dashboard, including the unique ID and type of the control. This recursive call will also allow you to see the resulting object for individual panels, such as this map control where we see the JSON objects for distinct layers:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt543ee43321a3216f/642d2c588f121010dc4c955b/kibana-node-debug-map.png\" alt=\"![Chrome Inspect](./images/kibana-node-debug-map.png)\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"identifyslowqueriesviathesearchslowlog\">Identify slow queries via the Search Slow Log</h2>\n<p>Expensive queries from dashboards can have a negative impact on the Elasticsearch server. Elasticsearch provides the search slow log to capture slow search queries into a dedicated log file. Locating slow searches to the originating visualization could help identify which particular control in your dashboard is impacting Elasticsearch performance. </p>\n<p>Queries logged to the slow log are determined per index by thresholds set for the query and fetch phases. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/understanding-query-then-fetch-vs-dfs-query-then-fetch\">useful blog</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-search.html#search-type\"><code>search_type</code></a> option in the Elasticsearch documentation for details on the default Query Then Fetch algorithm. </p>\n<p>Thresholds are set for query and fetch phases at four different log levels: <code>warn</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>debug</code> and <code>trace</code>. Thresholds are disabled using a value of -1 and can be changed at an index level in the Developer Console using the <code>_settings</code> API endpoint:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"console language-console\">PUT /kibana_sample_data_logs/_settings\n{\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn\": \"10s\",\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info\": \"5s\",\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.debug\": \"2s\",\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.trace\": \"500ms\",\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn\": \"1s\",\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.info\": \"800ms\",\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.debug\": \"500ms\",\n  \"index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.trace\": \"200ms\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once the thresholds have been configured, the logs for the configured levels will be sent to the slow log location. The search log location depends on whether you are using an on-prem Elasticsearch installation or Elastic Cloud. For on-prem installs, the slow log is located in the logs folder, which defaults to <code>/var/log/elasticsearch/</code> unless you have overridden the logs location within your <code>elasticsearch.yml</code> configuration. Elastic Cloud deployments require logs and metrics to be enabled on your cluster by following the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-enable-logging-and-monitoring.html#ec-enable-logging-and-monitoring-steps\">Enable logging and monitoring steps within the documentation</a>. Logs and metrics will be sent to the specified cluster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt62d8c997f68e18f4/642d2cf737ecbf10cadce167/elastic-cloud-console-logs-and-metrics-select-deployment.png\" alt=\"![Elastic Cloud Ship Logs and Metrics](./images/elastic-cloud-console-logs-and-metrics-select-deployment.png)\" /></p>\n<p>Irrespective of where your logs live, the slow log will show messages similar to the following: </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blte4220ef58cd65ae1/642d2d10884f2510c389391f/kibana-slowlog-highlight.png\" alt=\"![Elasticsearch Slow Log in Kibana](./images/kibana-slowlog-highlight.png)\" /></p>\n<p>Looking at messages in <em>Logs</em>, it's difficult to tie this source message back to an individual dashboard control. Each numbered item corresponds to the following entity. Element 1 contains the unique ID for the Kibana dashboard. Of more interest is segment 2 containing colon-separated information about the specific visualization:</p>\n<p><code>agg_based:gauge:69a34b00-9ee8-11e7-8711-e7a007dcef99</code></p>\n<p>This example has three key pieces of information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visualization type, in this case, <code>Lens</code></li>\n<li>The type of control, which here is the <code>Legacy Metric</code> control</li>\n<li>The unique ID of the visualization that has generated the slow query</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As of Elastic Stack 8.x, these IDs are unique to the global space, unlike prior versions where they were unique within the Kibana space they reside. Further details are given in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/saved-object-ids.html\">documentation</a>. </p>\n<p>A more human-friendly format can be obtained by cross-referencing the visualization ID from <code>elasticsearch.slowlog</code> with <code>kibana.log</code>. The <code>kibana.log</code> message for the above gauge control shows the <code>description</code> highlighted in blue:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltb12b7091c70b9ce5/642d2d6ecfb44c109a1d760e/kibana-logs-highlight.png\" alt=\"![Elasticsearch Kibana Log in Kibana](./images/kibana-logs-highlight.png)\" /></p>\n<p>The <code>description</code> can be matched against the title in the dashboard itself if the title is visible, or in the Saved Objects screen:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt9c9eac6e2bb8e6dc/642d2da2c6373410f683f944/kibana-saved-objects-screen.png\" alt=\"![Elasticsearch Saved Objects Kibana](./images/kibana-saved-objects-screen.png)\" /></p>\n<p>The <em>Inspect</em> panel within Saved Objects can also be used to cross-reference the ID:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt3859e664d1c4e2b4/642d2dcd7ae71310d19e1ee4/kibana-inspect-action.png\" alt=\"![Kibana Saved Objects Inspect Action](./images/kibana-inspect-action.png)\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"inspectorandsearchprofiler\">Inspector and Search Profiler</h2>\n<p>Once the offending visualization has been identified, the <em>Inspector</em> will help you access the query.

Hits returned versus hits match is not the same, not just because by default Elasticsearch queries return 10 hits, but also because many aggregations will not return documents for inclusion in their views as we will be interested in visualizing the aggregation results.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blta646c9f56fc22141/642d2e3eaa312f114ba7d3c9/kibana-inspect-panel.png\" alt=\"![Kibana](./images/kibana-inspect-panel.png)\" /></p>\n<p>The Request tab shows the query executed by this particular control. There are also options to copy the query to run in the Developer Console, or use the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/xpack-profiler.html\">Search Profiler</a> to identify slow stages of both the search and aggregation profiles of your query.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blta4de9dc02d77d594/642d2e5c66181410a573290b/search-profiler.png\" alt=\"![Kibana](./images/search-profiler.png)\" /></p>\n<p>The capabilities of each Inspect panel depend on the type of visualization used to give appropriate debugging options. The <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/maps-troubleshooting.html#_inspect_elasticsearch_requests\">Inspect panel for maps</a> allows you to see queries for each layer.

The concept of “least privilege” can be abstract, but this helps make it more practical: accounts that are not configured to run with only essential privileges make credential access much more likely to occur.</p>\n<p>For enterprises who aren’t ready to implement a least privilege model, the next best thing is to consistently monitor the use of OS-native utilities that can be used to steal credentials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whatarethemosteffectiverulesfordetection\">What are the most effective rules for detection?</h3>\n<p>Elastic has 21 rules for various credential access techniques, and four of those rules were responsible for about 73% of events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Credential Access via Known Utilities</li>\n<li>Security Account Manager (SAM) Registry Access</li>\n<li>Suspicious Access to LSA Secrets Registry</li>\n<li>Potential Credential Access via Mimikatz</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example of <em>Credential Access via Known Utilities</em> would be the <strong>NTDSUtil.exe</strong> tool. Active Directory relies on a database (<strong>NTDS.dit</strong>) which can be accessed offline or in memory to obtain the entire contents of Active Directory, including any configuration settings and credentials stored there. </p>\n<p><em>SAM Registry Access</em> is quite similar and involves various ways of copying various Registry hives for offline credential harvesting. Using an inexpensive physical or virtual machine, an adversary can quickly obtain sensitive credentials for use in a target environment. No special software is needed, <strong>reg.exe</strong> is all you need and comes on every version of Windows. </p>\n<p><em>Suspicious Access to LSA Secrets Registry</em> is similar, they can be pulled from the <strong>HKEY<em>LOCAL</em>MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Policy\\Secrets</strong> key value from the <strong>SECURITY</strong> hive.</p>\n<p><em>Potential Credential Access via Mimikatz</em> specifically looks for the Mimikatz tool, which may be the best-known and most feature-rich utility for obtaining credentials. However, enterprises shouldn’t obsess over Mimikatz: there are dozens of tools and scripts capable of achieving the same or similar results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatnext\">What next?</h2>\n<p>Threats can and will target credentials because they offer mobility, access, and the ability to masquerade as high-privilege users that might escape scrutiny. Because the majority of mechanisms are baked into each operating system, adversaries are likely to continue using native capabilities where they can.

Hear why.","Description":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">My passion is to work with the federal government and see how I can be a part of the mission. That’s why I wanted to work at Elastic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I first discovered my passion for tech sales as a college graduate working in Silicon Valley. I worked at Apple as a Technical Consultant and got my start in channel sales and the network IP space at a large company that provided solutions for semiconductor and infrastructure software. Then I moved to a startup that gave me the opportunity to support Civilian agencies, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Intelligence Community. In this role, I spent a lot of time flying between California and Washington D.C. and quickly realized that I had a great sense of fire and purpose when serving the federal government.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">These early experiences helped me find my strength working in sales and providing customers with the solutions they needed, while developing a strong foundation in the business of tech.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As a Federal Sales Director at Elastic, I’ve taken on delivering mission support within the federal space with a deeply rooted obligation to being in my customers’ corner, no matter what, and understanding their challenges to </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/federal?baymax=web&elektra=women-of-elastic-kathy-hsu-career-in-sales\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">help them find the solutions</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> they need for their Elastic journey.

Using the strengths, skills, and my fostered relationships, I have developed a selling style that feels natural to me, and earns the trust of my customers — something that’s incredibly important in any client relationship, but especially so in the federal business. The intricacies of working in the federal space is highly focused on relationships, understanding how to navigate contracts, how to enable your partner community, and most importantly, understanding the critical mission of the customer at the agency level and how it all connects back to us as individuals and citizens.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I realized over time that what makes you different shouldn’t be something that prevents you from moving forward. I use that as a way to stand out. As a woman and an Asian American, two groups that are often underrepresented in the tech sales industry, I have learned over the last 15 years to not let this lack of representation influence my narrative. Instead, I focused on being myself and learned how to develop a compelling personal brand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As a recent new mother of two, I continue to evolve and learn and feel fully supported at Elastic. </span><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/celebrating-supporting-and-valuing-women-around-the-world\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The generous parental leave</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> allowed me to cherish the special time to bond and feel eager to return to my team and customers.

I started my career at Elastic as a User Success Manager nearly 5 years ago. As a User Success Manager, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of different departments throughout the business. It was a great chance for me to see what it’s like to work in different departments throughout a company and to understand the mindset of someone who makes decisions on the other side of a big sales deal. This allowed me to prepare myself for the sales role that I am in today.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Unlike other companies where the sales journey can be heavily reliant on one sales employee, I work collaboratively with numerous colleagues. When the tech gets complicated, I have a technical representative who supports me. We also work with a sales development team to support account executives to create a pipeline.

There are so many opportunities in the region — we have a lot of users, and there are many businesses interested in the solutions we provide. I travel to visit clients across Central and Eastern Europe and organize events to raise awareness about Elastic solutions and the ways we help companies to gain valuable insights from their big data.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">I hosted an Elastic Day in Warsaw, Poland recently with our partner. We had an incredible turn out from our users and customers. I like doing events like these because I’m able to speak directly to devops and security teams to share the latest and greatest from Elastic.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Day-to-day, I’m talking to people and guiding them through how Elastic can help. I find out about their projects and help them understand how Elastic can solve some of their problems.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">When I started at Elastic, I was working in Munich as a sales development representative.

Travelling has always been a dream of mine and I’m happy to have found a job that allows me to do that. This year, I want to continue to travel to visit partners and customers and introduce them to Elastic. With sales, I have a problem to solve, we solve it together, and I get a lot of satisfaction from that.</span></p><h3><strong>Huage Chen, principal solutions architect</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt48ce6286293d75b5/640b7116ff39cb107b872952/Huage.jpeg\" height=\"auto\"/></p><p>I came to Elastic from a company that was using <a href=\"http://elastic.co/products/?baymax=web&elektra=culture-meet-the-team-at-elastic-emea-go-to-market\" target=\"_self\">our products</a> for an OEM solution, so I was already in love with the technology. My role is multifaceted because I can join the sales cycle at many different points. In the discovery phases or the initial call, I try to help the account executive on the qualification and opportunity side. For the customer, I try to be their number one contact person, the one they consider as a trusted advisor. My role is not to sell. My role instead is to provide guidance from that first discovery call to a good solution, that will provide a benefit to the customer.</p><p>We do what we have to do in these scenarios. The sales cycle might take four months, eight months, a year — but throughout we want our customers to feel that we’re working with them, not rushing them, to finalize a project. Decision makers are cautious these days because they know migrating from an existing product to a new one can have a financial impact, so they want to make sure they’re making the correct choice. I invest in a customer in the same way as they invest in us. It takes time and the relationship that we build is one for the long term. It’s all about <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/about/our-source-code?baymax=web&elektra=culture-meet-the-team-at-elastic-emea-go-to-market\" target=\"_self\">simple progress toward perfection</a>.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);font-size: 12pt;\">I think my favorite part of the job is the people, and building these relationships. Since I joined Elastic, I’ve been working in multiple regions, and spending time with others, helping solve problems, is really precious. It’s what I enjoy the most.</span></p><h3><strong>Kathleen Gluck-Baud, public sector account executive, south EMEA</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf20ae6e6195cb79a/607dbede6371c75a11ad98bd/Kathleen.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltf20ae6e6195cb79a\" alt=\"Kathleen Gluck-Baud\"/></p><p>I started as a salesperson about 12 years ago. In many companies when you work in sales, you’re often working alone. Here at Elastic, though, you have a big virtual team that supports you. You have legal, your solution architect, and a user success manager who will care for the customer after a sale. They are very present throughout the process, which allows you to do your job better.</p><p>In the public sector, the sales cycle can take between eight months and a year. What’s different and excellent about Elastic is that the customer is already aware of the solution through a basic license. So when you’re animating a proof of concept and showing all the value of functionalities such as security and machine learning available through the paid subscription, you’re able to surprise and delight the customer.</p><p>When you are a salesperson here at Elastic, you are quite free to organize your schedule as you want. What it comes down to is your results. You’re often given freedom to do your job with a creative spin. I think Elastic is a bit forward-thinking in this space.</p><p>What I also like about this work is that work is never finished. You’re never just sitting in front of a white page. There are always opportunities to enlarge your impact and drive new initiatives. People listen to you when you have a great idea and help you execute on it. Elastic lives by the ethos that you’re going to do an excellent job when you feel comfortable to be yourself.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);font-size: 12pt;\">Interested in joining Elastic’s sales team?

As a wife, mother of two young boys, and sales leader, Rain optimizes her time so that she can show up fully and authentically in all aspects of her life. </p><p>We sat down with Rain, <span style='color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-size: 11pt;'>Area Vice President, ASEAN and Greater China&nbsp;</span> at Elastic, to learn how she has built a career she loves. Read on to learn about how she grew her career in tech sales and what advice she has for others looking to do the same. </p><p><p></p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt8fdc37719f4d18ac/6408c3ec9a3afb6a24eba3b4/Elastic_-_Rain_(1)_(1).png\" height=\"auto\"/></p><h2>Launching a career in tech sales</h2><p>Shortly after graduating with her MBA, a headhunter contacted Rain about a position in sales. \"When they pitched this sales job to me, I found it very interesting,\" she says. Although she didn't have any sales experience, she liked the idea of helping clients find solutions. \"And at the same time they talked about the commission piece, and as a fresh grad, I also found that very attractive.\" </p><p>Over fifteen years later, Rain has earned her stripes in sales and team management. After holding executive positions at various well-known companies, Rain began to seek more opportunities for growth. \"I wanted to join a growing company where I would be able to build and grow with the company,\" she says. And that's how she found Elastic. </p><p>Apart from the job description, Elastic's culture and values were what won her over when she decided to join three years ago. \"Elastic's source code says we are not here to strive for perfection, so when I saw that, I immediately knew that this is the company that I would like to join, because we are not perfect — we are human.\" </p><p>As a salesperson, quality human connection at work is major for Rain. \"[Sometimes] I see my colleagues more than I see my family, so liking the people I work with makes a big difference.\" </p><p>Equally important, however, is having the support required to maintain those connections at work <em>and</em> at home. \"Elastic's culture gives us the flexibility to find that balance,\" says Rain. </p><h2>Building and growing alongside Elastic</h2><p>When Rain joined Elastic in 2018, there were only five employees in ASEAN and Hong Kong Singapore headquarters.&nbsp;She now manages over 10 countries with more than 10 languages spoken in the APJ and ASEAN regions. \"It has been an amazing journey,\" says Rain. </p><p>Rain attributes this success to learning from her fellow colleagues. \"I would say the secret recipe is being able to connect the dots and learn from other Elasticians.\" She makes sure her team has the opportunity to connect and learn from one another to accelerate growth and ensure optimal business outcomes: \"Together, we make the difference.\" </p><h2>How to grow your career in tech sales</h2><p>Whether you're new to tech sales or are looking for ways to advance even further in the industry, here's Rain's advice for growing your career in tech sales. </p><p>1. <strong>Enjoy what you do.</strong> Being passionate about your career will give you an extra boost of motivation that could help take your career to the next level. \"Today is the youngest you will ever be again, so that's why you should enjoy it to the fullest.\" </p><p>2. <strong>Get a mentor.</strong> \"With a mentor, you will be able to bounce ideas, know your shortcomings, develop your strengths, and learn something new.\" Rain has personally benefited from mentorship and always encourages others to do so as well. \"You need to be able to speak transparently to this person so that he or she will be able to give you the advice [you most need to hear].\" </p><p>3. <strong>Be a team player.</strong> \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" While sales may seem like an individual effort, success wouldn't be possible without the rest of the team. \"People always say, 'Rain, you are number one', but to me this is just a name tag, because there is a full village behind the scenes and they are the heroes actually.\" </p><p>4. <strong>Get constructive feedback.</strong> Ask your supervisors, clients, and fellow team members to comment on your work. \"Don't be afraid of asking for feedback,\" Rain says. \"It might hurt sometimes, but that is what will help you to improve and become a better version of yourself.\" </p><p>5. <strong>Have resilience.</strong> Rain learned the value of resilience from her 7-year-old son who competes on Singapore's national chess team. \"He started competing at a higher level and realized that he wouldn't always win,\" she explains.

In addition to telling us about how well features work for them, it also represents our visibility of the threat landscape.</p>\n<p>About 34% of the techniques we saw were related to defense evasion, which we believe is a direct result of endpoint security innovations. Because <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/about/free-and-open\">we believe in free and open principles</a>, we wanted to get a little deeper into what we observed and why it’s important for 2023 and beyond.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsthedefenseevasioncategory\">What’s the defense evasion category?</h2>\n<p>The Defense Evasion <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005/\">tactic</a> includes 42 techniques at the time of this publication, dozens of sub-techniques, and a nearly infinite number of procedural variations. In simplest terms, each of these capabilities can be used to avoid detection by an analyst or technology. </p>\n<p>During 2022, most of the behaviors we observed were in this category, and that’s not surprising given how security controls have improved over the past few years. </p>\n<p>A decade ago (when Windows XP was still pretty common in Enterprises), few organizations had a powerful endpoint deployed to detect and mitigate technique-level threat capabilities. If they did, it was prohibitively expensive and needed many hours of manual configuration to get results.</p>\n<p>Those days of weak visibility and strictly premium options for shaping the environment are behind us. Powerful tools like <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security/endpoint-security\">Elastic Endpoint</a> are freely available and come equipped with capabilities that quickly mitigate threats. Just as security instrumentation became more sophisticated, so have operating systems. Together with a heightened awareness of threats, these factors mean adversaries need to work faster or buy themselves time by being evasive.</p>\n<p>Our Global Threat Report revealed the following breakdown of preferred adversary techniques:\n<img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt2487d0985be05f04/63e50c776918a756577e8287/image1.png\" alt=\"Most frequently seen techniques in the Defense Evasion category\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatkindsofdefenseevasionsdidwesee\">What kinds of defense evasions did we see?</h2>\n<p>In 2022, we saw more than 15,000 defense evasion attempts using the following techniques (all available to the community via the <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/rules\">detection-rules</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/protections-artifacts/\">protections-artifacts</a> repositories in compatible rule formats):\nMasqueradingSystem Binary Proxy ExecutionAccess Token ManipulationProcess InjectionBITS JobsTrusted Developer Utilities Proxy ExecutionXSL Script ProcessingImpair DefensesExploitation for Defense EvasionSystem Script Proxy ExecutionModify RegistryIndicator Removal on Host</p>\n<h3 id=\"masqueradingdoesnotrequireanexpensivemask\">Masquerading does not require an expensive mask</h3>\n<p>Masquerading and System Binary Proxy Execution were the two most common defense evasion techniques, representing roughly 74% of attempts we observed. This is perhaps unsurprising because these techniques are also simple, free, and effective against some types of immature security technologies.</p>\n<p>Masquerading attempts to convince an observer (user or security instrumentation) that something malicious (behavior, capability) is benign/legitimate. An example of masquerading might be executing malware renamed <strong>svchost.exe</strong> to blend in with other legitimate processes on a system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"livingoffthelandwithbuiltinproxies\">Living off the land with built-in proxies</h3>\n<p>Binary proxy execution is an attempt to execute malicious capabilities using an indirect/secondary mechanism, usually built-in software that is otherwise benign. Common examples include administrative utilities like <strong>MSBuild</strong> or <strong>rundll32</strong>, and executing in a privileged context like local administrator may bypass security and other controls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatarethemosteffectiverulesfordetection\">What are the most effective rules for detection?</h2>\n<p>Elastic has 48 rules for various defense evasion techniques, and 3 of those rules were responsible for about 45% of events:\nBinary Masquerading via Untrusted PathParent Process PID SpoofingSuspicious Parent/Child Relationship</p>\n<p>For an example of a binary masquerading via an untrusted path, look no further than <strong>explorer.exe</strong>. The legitimate <strong>explorer.exe</strong> can be found in *<em>c:\\windows*</em> where it plays an important role in the UX for Windows operating systems. A malicious binary can be renamed *<em>explorer.exe</em>* and deployed to other directories, like *<em>C:\\windows\\debug*</em>, to confuse an analyst or security sensor.</p>\n<p>Parent process PID spoofing is just that: a malicious process returns the PID of a trusted process instead of its own, which can elevate privileges through inheritance or defeat parent-child detection mechanisms. If your security instrumentation is looking for unusual processes spawned from <strong>outlook.exe</strong>, this could change that to practically any other process.</p>\n<p>Suspicious parent-child relationship was the next most popular rule in the defense evasion category. Most system processes designed with the operating system in mind execute system software predictably — every time network services are started, they are started in the exact same way. Therefore, a winning detection strategy may be to look for services started atypically, or even rarely. This same concept can be broadly applied to cover several different kinds of defense evasion. One example might be <strong>installutil.exe</strong> as a descendant of <strong>winword.exe</strong>, indicating the Word application launched <strong>installutil.exe</strong>, a utility for installing software. Using the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/detecting-living-off-the-land-attacks-with-new-elastic-integration\">ProblemChild</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/detecting-living-off-the-land-attacks-with-new-elastic-integration\">Living off the Land</a> machine learning integrations can help identify suspicious parent-child relationships.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatnext\">What next?</h2>\n<p>Adversaries will continue to abuse built-in binary proxies to evade security instrumentation in 2023. Many benign utilities will dutifully execute malware, which alone may defeat inexperienced human analysts. Some security tools don’t monitor or analyze these second-order executions, allowing an attacker to succeed. Visibility is the first step toward achieving a capability that puts your environment under your control.</p>\n<p>Elastic Security provides both.

When it comes to sophisticated attacks, one of the most commonly seen tactics is Lateral Movement. During lateral movement, many attackers try impersonating a legitimate user by abusing admin tools (e.g., SMB, SAMBA, FTP, WMI, WinRM, and PowerShell Remoting) to move laterally from system to system in search of sensitive information. In addition, they may avoid using traditional malware to stay beneath the security radar, making detection more difficult.</p>\n<p>This publication will discuss the newly available <a href=\"https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/lmd\">Lateral Movement Detection package</a> under Kibana’s integrations app. Our new package includes anomaly detection jobs and security rules and takes advantage of the endpoint malware classifier to make finding Lateral Movement in your network simpler.</p>\n<h2 id=\"briefintroductiontolateralmovement\">Brief introduction to Lateral Movement</h2>\n<p>Lateral movement is a class of techniques used by adversaries to access resources in an enterprise that may store valuable data or sensitive information. For the purposes of our package, it also pertains to remote execution events that leverage the same protocols. These techniques play an essential role in the mobility of attackers who have established a foothold in the network and need to access one or more other systems until they achieve their ultimate objective(s). This may include accessing or destroying sensitive files and running a malicious payload on the target system.</p>\n<p>Intrusions can escalate quickly as adversaries attempt to outmaneuver security technologies and analysts. Preventative measures such as enterprise controls (segmentation), endpoint capabilities (sensors with detection capabilities), and user entity behavior analytics (UEBA) exist, but none of these can address all the possible use cases alone. </p>\n<h2 id=\"ourapproach\">Our approach</h2>\n<p>Typically, attackers rely on built-in protocols to deploy malicious software on victim hosts or to move data outside the enterprise network. Evaluating the use of these protocols is a key aspect of how Elastic escalates these behaviors to your attention.</p>\n<p>Our new <strong>Lateral Movement Detection</strong> framework complements behavioral and endpoint detections to provide mitigations against malicious software. In addition, several anomaly detection jobs are employed to profile host-to-host file transfer behavior. To monitor file transfers at the endpoint, we look for file “creation” events with a “process.name” of “smbd,” “system,” “vsftpd,” “sftp-server,” “sshd,” or “scp.” The aforementioned “process.name” values correspond to the five most commonly used file-transfer protocols for Windows and Linux hosts (e.g., SAMBA, SMB/PS Remoting, FTP, SFTP, SSH, and SCP). For this package, we decided to start with these services first with the aim of expanding the capability in future releases.</p>\n<p>The table below demonstrates a host to host matrix with their respective services:\n<img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltae94021bd849dd7b/63dab920df2bf910c8031770/Table1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>We filter file creation events based on the above table and use file metadata such as file size, extension, and directory to profile hosts for abnormal file transfer activities using anomaly detection jobs. These jobs flag potentially malicious activity by looking for spikes in file creation events, large amounts of data transfer, and rare file extensions and directories. Such outliers in the file transfer activities and metadata could indicate compromise, and may suggest that someone is trying to move malicious content across the network.  </p>\n<p>The following flowchart depicts the Lateral Movement Detection package at work (note numbers are examples for illustrative purposes)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd47b6531753c3c19/63daba42c8540a111ada8be6/image9.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Moreover, our package also uses detection rules and endpoint features like the MalwareScore classifier — mixing and matching features to add confidence. For instance, we look for file “creation” and “modification” in sensitive directories, (e.g., admin shares for windows, dot, config, and bin files for Linux). Adversaries may attempt to create or modify files in folders like “bin,” where they can execute a malicious binary hidden among legitimate ones. In addition, we use the correlation between remote file creation events and MalwareScore detections to identify a malicious file transfer, one of the most common ways malware propagates in an enterprise. Our model is trained on a diverse feature set, allowing it to learn all the patterns in data pointing toward a malicious file. Finding and implementing these patterns using behavioral logic is tedious and could result in more noise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting started</h2>\n<p>As of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-8-6-0\">8.6</a>, users can install the <a href=\"https://docs.elastic.co/integrations/lmd\">Lateral Movement Detection package</a> from the Integrations app in Kibana. If you don’t have an Elastic Cloud cluster but would like to start experimenting with the package, you can <a href=\"https://cloud.elastic.co/registration\">start a free 14-day trial</a> of Elastic Cloud.</p>\n<p>To set up and begin using the Lateral Movement Detection package, follow the steps listed below. </p>\n<h3 id=\"step1installingthepackage\">Step 1: Installing the package</h3>\n<p>In the Kibana integration app, the new Lateral Movement Detection package is available. To install, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and click on <strong>Install Lateral Movement Detection assets</strong>. This will install all the artifacts under this package to generate events and alerts when Lateral Movement is detected in the file transfer activity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbc8c1b2399305c59/63dabaefb369f5745550cb74/image3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"step2runninganomalydetectionjobs\">Step 2: Running anomaly detection jobs</h3>\n<p>As discussed above, this package consists of several prebuilt anomaly detection jobs. To run these jobs, go to <strong>Machine Learning > Anomaly Detection</strong>. Go to the <strong>Jobs</strong> wizard under <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> and click on <strong>Create job</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt33c25538544d0889/63dabc1fe4e29e75dc5df15c/image8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Select the <strong>Lateral Movement Detection</strong> card under the Use preconfigured jobs option and click on the <strong>Create jobs</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt089e8f4ba2c7663c/63dabcf88e456d21046c7d1b/image1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"step3enablingsecuritydetectionrules\">Step 3: Enabling security detection rules</h3>\n<p>This package uses anomaly detection jobs, security rules, and the endpoint malware classifier to detect lateral movement in the network. To see all the Lateral Movement Detection alerts, you need to enable all the installed detection rules under the package. The rules based on anomaly detection jobs are triggered when the anomaly score surpasses a predetermined threshold which can be customized by duplicating the detection rule. </p>\n<p>To enable and use the installed rules, navigate to <strong>Security > Alerts > Manage rules</strong> and select** Load Elastic prebuild rules and timeline templates**. If you’re running in Elastic Cloud, this step is done automatically.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4305ca36ebf0f392/63dabd823d28dd4dde642c67/image5.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>You can use the <strong>Lateral Movement Detection</strong> tag to filter for all the detection rules under this package.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltc1096222f3ca421a/63dabdda5d9574542d40b99c/image2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>To enable a specific rule, click on the <strong>Enabled</strong> toggle corresponding to the rule name.

With one hand, they hold it high as a powerful resource, and with the other, they criticize some aspect of it. But regardless of your viewpoint on any given day, ATT&amp;CK is one of the most important resources for improving your understanding of threat capabilities and aligning those to technical controls, countermeasures, or mitigations. </p>\n<p>We at Elastic know a bit about ATT&amp;CK — not only as a tool for detection engineering, but also from our experience in the MITRE Engenuity ATT&amp;CK evaluations (link) — having participated since the very beginning. Our most recent MITRE evaluation <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-protects-against-ransomware-and-linux-threats-in-mitre-engenuity-round-4-eval\">results</a> were strong. </p>\n<p>Comprehension is, unfortunately, expensive — in terms of both time and other limited resources. ATT&amp;CK improves comprehension in a uniquely inexpensive way, aligning objectives (tactics) to capabilities (techniques and procedures) with: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Descriptions that explain each capability with examples</li>\n<li>References describing how techniques were used in the wild</li>\n<li>Links to resources like the Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elastic’s core mission and philosophy is based on the principles of <a href=\"https://www.blackhat.com/sponsor-posts/07292020-elastic.html\">openness</a> and transparency. It is in this spirit that we’re excited to announce our partnership with <a href=\"http://www.tidalcyber.com/\">Tidal Cyber</a> to improve transparency even further, and help Tidal and Elastic users understand the capabilities we’re providing in the language of ATT&amp;CK. Using Tidal’s free <a href=\"https://app.tidalcyber.com?utm_campaign=Community%20Edition&utm_source=elastic\">Community Edition</a>, users can access the registry of detections provided by different vendors and products, collection of Campaigns, Groups, and more from MITRE — then map them to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix, analyzing both coverage and gaps.</p>\n<p>Elastic embraces <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/about/free-and-open\">free and open software</a>, and shares our detection logic for well over 1,000 rules and signatures mapped to ATT&amp;CK. Many organizations rely on several security technologies to prepare a defense-in-depth strategy, and comparing Elastic capabilities side-by-side with other vendors helps indicate where that strategy has gaps.</p>\n<p>Where most vendors maintain their logic in closed sources, ours at Elastic is fully transparent. Because Elastic champions community-facing development, that also means you have a role to play. We invite you to share in our development processes and ensure our technology is something you can expect for yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request we close a gap by opening an issue in one of our public repositories</li>\n<li>Submit a rule of your own that benefits the community</li>\n<li>Tell us about noisy rules and help us improve them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The edge of your enterprise is more than just your user workstations and servers. It extends to essential technologies you may not have direct control over. Elastic has been working to address this kind of complexity since the creation of the Elastic Security solution, which is why we began <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/tree/main/rules/integrations/\">sharing logic</a> for enterprise applications like Okta and cloud service providers like AWS as early as 7.9 version. We support Tidal’s effort to make it easier for users to assess Enterprise ATT&amp;CK coverage, and seize control of their environments. </p>\n<p>What we see is that threats are moving faster, they’re hitting harder, and organizations are at a distinct disadvantage when they can’t answer basic questions about coverage. You don’t know what you don’t know (or what your vendor keeps locked away as intellectual property), and we’re teaming up with Tidal to ensure we’re part of the solution and not the problem. </p>\n<p>We enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODPfny9xAY4&feature=youtu.be\">our fireside chat</a> with Tidal, during which we shared our thoughts on rule development in and with the community and the importance of free and open security solutions. We’d love to hear from you about how we’re doing. </p>\n<p>Join our <a href=\"http://elasticstack.slack.com\">Slack community</a> to share your thoughts about putting MITRE ATT&amp;CK to good use in your enterprise, maintaining and optimizing coverage.</p>","PublishedAt":"2022-12-13 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-tidal-making-mitre-att-ck-easier","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2515,"Title":"Why Splunk customers face a choice for observability and modernization","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-12-12 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-splunk-customers-face-a-choice-for-observability-and-modernization","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2518,"Title":"Analyze and visualize Strava activity details with the Elastic Stack","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-12-12 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/analyze-visualize-strava-activity-details-elastic-stack","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2482,"Title":"Elastic Stack 8.5.3 released","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-12-08 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-stack-8-5-3-released","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2486,"Title":"3 cybersecurity strategies for healthcare leaders in a digital-first world","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-12-08 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/3-cybersecurity-strategies-healthcare-leaders-digital-first-world","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2472,"Title":"How Universal Profiling unwinds stacks without frame pointers and symbols","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-12-07 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/universal-profiling-frame-pointers-symbols-ebpf","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2452,"Title":"5 questions public sector leaders should be asking about their data","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-12-05 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/5-questions-public-sector-leaders-should-be-asking-about-their-data","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2435,"Title":"Elastic named a Major Player in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide SIEM 2022 Vendor Assessment","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-12-01 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-named-major-player-idc-marketscape-worldwide-siem-2022","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2429,"Title":"CEO Ash Kulkarni's email to Elastic employees","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-11-30 21:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/ceo-ash-kulkarni-email-to-elastic-employees","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2383,"Title":"ERGs encourage you to come as you are: Meet ElastAsians","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-11-29 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-ergs-encourage-you-to-come-as-you-are-meet-elastasians","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2355,"Title":"How to import Strava data into the Elastic Stack","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-11-28 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/how-to-import-strava-data-elastic-stack","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2316,"Title":"Wait… Elastic Observability monitors metrics for AWS services in just minutes?","Description":"","PublishedAt":"2022-11-22 00:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/aws-service-metrics-monitor-observability-easy","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":2320,"Title":"Elastic Stack 8.5.2 released","Description":"<p>Version 8.5.2 of the Elastic Stack was released today.

But, be assured that Elastic RUM is equally wonderful! Let’s take a sip! I do want to warn you that it will take a bit of time to go through the amount of detail I will cover in this blog.</p><h2>What is RUM?</h2><p>Elastic <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/js-base/4.x/index.html\" target=\"_self\">real user monitoring</a>, or RUM, captures user interactions with the web browser and provides a detailed view of the “real user experience” of your web applications from a performance perspective. Elastic’s RUM Agent is a <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/js-base/current/index.html\" target=\"_self\">JavaScript Agent</a>, which means it supports any JavaScript-based application. RUM can provide valuable insight into your applications. Some of the common benefits of RUM include:</p><ul><li>RUM performance data can help you identify bottlenecks and discover how site performance issues affect your visitors’ experience</li><li>User agent information captured by RUM enables you to identify the browsers, devices, and platforms most used by your customers so that you can make informed optimizations to your application</li><li>Together with location information, individual user performance data from RUM helps you understand regional performance of your website worldwide</li><li>RUM provides insight and measurement for your application’s service level agreements (SLA)</li><li>RUM gathers information on customer visit and click behavior over time that can be useful for development teams to identify the impact of new features</li></ul><h2>Getting started with RUM using Elastic APM</h2><p>In this blog, I will take you through the complete process of instrumenting a simple web application made of a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend, step by step. You will see how easy it is to use the RUM agent. As a bonus, you will also see how Elastic APM ties the frontend and the backend performance information together with a holistic, distributed trace view. Please see this previous blog for an overview of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/distributed-tracing-opentracing-and-elastic-apm\" target=\"_self\">Elastic APM and distributed tracing</a> if you are interested in knowing more details.</p><p>To use Elastic APM real user monitoring, you have to have the Elastic Stack with APM server installed. You can of course <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/downloads\" target=\"_self\">download</a> and install the latest Elastic Stack with APM server locally on your computer. However, the easiest approach would be creating an <a href=\"http://cloud.elastic.co\" target=\"_self\">Elastic Cloud</a> trial account and have your cluster ready in a few minutes. APM is enabled for the default I/O Optimized template. From now on, I’ll assume you have a cluster ready to go.</p><h3>Sample application</h3><p>The application we are going to instrument is a simple car database application made of a <a href=\"https://github.com/adamquan/carfront\" target=\"_self\">React frontend</a> and a <a href=\"https://github.com/adamquan/cardatabase\" target=\"_self\">Spring Boot backend</a> that provides API access to an in-memory car database. The application is purposely kept simple. The idea is to show you detailed instrumentation steps starting from zero so that you can instrument your own applications following the same steps.</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt6977d5827da59b86/5cb842a444c599c63eef1a56/sip-of-rum-1.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt6977d5827da59b86\" alt=\"A simple application with a React frontend and Spring backend\"/></p><p>Create a directory called CarApp anywhere on your laptop. Then clone both the frontend and the backend application into that directory.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">git clone https://github.com/carlyrichmond/carfront<br/>git clone https://github.com/carlyrichmond/cardatabase<br/></pre><p>As you can see, the application is extremely simple. There are only a couple of components in the React frontend and a few classes in the backend Spring Boot application. Build and run the application following the instructions in GitHub for both the frontend and backend. You should see something like this. You can browse, filter cars, and perform CRUD options on them.</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt7b68f2ba2628a996/5cb842a02a4acbd72a4882e5/sip-of-rum-2.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt7b68f2ba2628a996\" alt=\"The simple React user interface\"/></p><p>Now, with the application up running, we are ready to go through the instrumentation using the RUM agent.</p><h3>Rich out-of-the-box instrumentation with RUM</h3><p>An Elastic APM server is needed to get started. You will need to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/current/configuration-rum.html#rum-enable\" target=\"_self\">enable RUM</a> to capture the events from your RUM agent. To set up your RUM agent, there are two ways of doing so:</p><ol><li>You can install the RUM agent as a project dependency via a package manager such as npm:<pre class=\"prettyprint\">npm install @elastic/apm-rum --save<br/></pre></li><li>Include the RUM agent via the HTML script tag. <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/rum-js/current/install-the-agent.html\" target=\"_self\">Note this can be performed as either a blocking or non-blocking operation as per the documentation</a>.<br/><pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;script <br/>src=\"https://unpkg.com/@elastic/apm-rum@5.12.0/dist/bundles/elastic-apm-rum.umd.min.js\"&gt;<br/>&lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;script&gt;<br/>  elasticApm.init({<br/>    serviceName: 'carfront',<br/>    serverUrl: 'http://localhost:8200',<br/>    serviceVersion: '0.90'<br/>  })<br/>&lt;/script&gt;<br/></pre></li></ol><p>Since our frontend is a React application, we are going to use the first approach. Once you've installed @elastic/apm-rum in your project, check out the initialization code in rum.js . This is located in the same directory as your index.js and will look a bit like this, but with serviceUrl replaced with your own APM server endpoint:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">import { init as initApm } from '@elastic/apm-rum'<br/>var apm = initApm({<br/> // Set required service name (allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space)<br/> serviceName: 'carfront',<br/> // Set the version of your application<br/> // Used on the APM Server to find the right sourcemap<br/> serviceVersion: '0.90',<br/> // Set custom APM Server URL (default: http://localhost:8200)<br/> serverUrl: 'APM_URL',<br/> // distributedTracingOrigins: ['http://localhost:8080'],<br/>})<br/>export default apm;<br/></pre><p>That’s all it takes to initialize the RUM agent! If you are making use of framework specific features, such as routing in React, Angular, or Vue, you may want to also install and configure the framework specific integrations as well, which are covered in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/rum-js/current/framework-integrations.html\" target=\"_self\">documentation</a>. In this case, as this is a single page that doesn't require React specific instrumentation, we have not installed the additional dependency.</p><p>Don't worry about distributedTracingOrigins right now. Here's a quick explanation of some of the other configurations:</p><ol><li><strong>Service name:</strong> The service name has to be set. It represents your application in the APM UI. Name it something meaningful.</li><li><strong>Service version:</strong> This is the version of your application. This version number is also used by the APM server to find the right source map. We will discuss the source map in detail later.</li><li><strong>Server URL:</strong> This is the APM server URL. Note that the APM server URL is normally accessible from the public internet because your RUM agent reports data to it from end-user browsers on the internet.</li></ol><p>People who are familiar with Elastic APM backend agents might be wondering why the APM token was not passed here. That’s because the RUM agent doesn't actually use a secret APM token. The token is only used for backend agents. Because the frontend code is public, the secret token does not provide additional security.</p><p>We will load this JavaScript file when the application loads and include it in places that we want to perform custom instrumentation. For now, let’s see what we get out of the box, without any custom instrumentation. To do so, we simply need to include rum.js in index.js . The index.js file imports rum.js and sets a page load name. Without setting a page load name, you will see the page load listed as “/” in the APM UI, which is not very intuitive. Here is what index.js looks like.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">import apm from './rum'<br/>import React from 'react';<br/>import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';<br/>import './index.css';<br/>import App from './App';<br/>import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';<br/>apm.setInitialPageLoadName(\"Car List\")<br/>ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));<br/>serviceWorker.unregister();<br/></pre><p>Generate some traffic to your application by accessing pages and adding or deleting cars. Then log into Kibana and click on the Observability tile. From there, select the Services option from the APM submenu, as shown below:</p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt7aba56906f514b72/63504a2919d8652169cfad8c/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-1.png\" height=\"auto\"/><p></p><p>You should see a service called \"carfront\" listed. Clicking on the service name takes you to the transaction page. You should see an overview of metrics such as latency and throughput for the default time frame of \"Last 15 minutes.\" If not, change the time picker to this range.</p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt71bb7e870ae40a92/63504a83bbff0b3fd98e25e1/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-2.png\" height=\"auto\"/><p></p><p>In the transactions segment, you should see the \"Car List\" transaction. Click on the \"Car List\" link, and you will move to the Transaction tab, which contains statistics for this sample of transactions. Scrolling to the bottom of the page, you will see a waterfall view of browser interactions like this:</p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt62e1a3ddd74a6719/63504ad4b3f39b38fccfe7db/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-3.png\" height=\"auto\"/><p></p><p>Amazed by how much information is captured by the RUM agent by default? Pay special attention to the <strong>markers</strong> at the top like timeToFirstByte, domInteractive, domComplete, and firstContentfulPaint. Mouse over the black dots to see the names. They provide you with great details about content retrieval and browser rendering of these contents. Also, pay attention to all the performance data about resource loading from the browser. By just initializing your RUM agent, without any custom instrumentation, you get all these detailed performance metrics, out of the box! When there is a performance issue, these metrics enable you to easily decide whether the issue is due to slow backend services, a slow network, or simply a slow client browser. That is very impressive!</p><p></p><p>For those of you who need a refresher, here is a quick explanation of the web performance metrics. Do keep in mind that for modern web application frameworks like React, these metrics might only represent the “static” part of the web page, due to the async nature of React. For example, dynamic contents might still be loading after <strong>domInteractive</strong>, as you will see later.</p><ul><li><strong>timeToFirstByte</strong> is the amount of time a browser waits to receive the first piece of information from the web server after requesting it. It represents a combination of network and server-side processing speed.</li><li><strong>domInteractive</strong> is the time immediately before the user agent sets the current document readiness to “interactive,” which means the browser has finished parsing all of the HTML and DOM construction has completed.</li><li><strong>domComplete</strong> is the time immediately before the user agent sets the current document readiness to “complete,” which means the page and all of its subresources like images have finished downloading and are ready. The loading spinner has stopped spinning.</li><li><strong>firstContentfulPaint</strong> is the time the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM. This is an important milestone for users because it provides feedback that the page is actually loading.</li></ul><h3>Flexible custom instrumentation</h3><p>The RUM agent provides detailed instrumentation for your browser interaction out of the box, as you just saw. You can also perform custom instrumentations when needed. For example, because the React application is a single-page-application and deleting a car will not trigger a “page load,” RUM does not by default capture the performance data of deleting a car. We can use custom transactions for something like that.</p><p>With our current release (APM Real User Monitoring JavaScript Agent 5.x), AJAX calls and click events are captured by the agent and sent to the APM server. <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/rum-js/current/configuration.html#disable-instrumentations\" target=\"_self\">Configuring the types of interactions can be achieved using the disableInstrumentation setting</a>.</p><p>It is also possible to add your own custom instrumentations to give more meaningful traces. This can particularly be useful for tracing new features. In our example application, the <strong>\"New Car\"</strong> button in our frontend application allows you to add a new car to the database. We will instrument the code to capture the performance of adding a new car. Open the file Carlist.js in the components directory. You will see the following code:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">// Add new car<br/>addCar(car) {<br/>    // Add car metadata as labels to the RUM click transaction<br/>    var transaction = apm.startTransaction(\"Add Car\", \"Car\");<br/>    transaction.addLabels(car);<br/>    fetch(SERVER_URL + 'api/cars',<br/>        {<br/>            method: 'POST',<br/>            headers: {<br/>                'Content-Type': 'application/json',<br/>            },<br/>            body: JSON.stringify(car)<br/>        })<br/>        .then(res =&gt; this.fetchCars())<br/>        .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err))<br/>}<br/>fetchCars = () =&gt; {<br/>    fetch(SERVER_URL + 'api/cars')<br/>        .then((response) =&gt; response.json())<br/>        .then((responseData) =&gt; {<br/>            this.setState({<br/>                cars: responseData._embedded.cars,<br/>            });<br/>        })<br/>        .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));<br/>        // End the current transaction at the end of the response call back<br/>        var transaction = apm.getCurrentTransaction()<br/>        if (transaction) transaction.end()<br/>}<br/></pre><p>The code basically created a new transaction called <strong>“Add Car”</strong> of <strong>“Car”</strong> type. Then, it tagged the transaction with the car to provide contextual information. We then explicitly ended the transaction at the end of the method.</p><p>Add a new car from the application web UI. Click on the APM UI in Kibana. You should see an “Add Car” transaction listed. Make sure you select “Car” in the “Filter by type” dropdown. By default, it displays “page-load” transactions.</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltcad2c799aa1c6e1b/63504d554e565f1cdce2944e/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-4.png\" height=\"auto\"/></p><p>Click on the “Add Car” transaction link. You should see performance information of the custom transaction “Add Car”:</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltda3d29bf6e005b2a/63504d720528631ea56813e7/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-5.png\" height=\"auto\"/></p><p>Click on the “Metadata” tab. You will see the labels we added along with the default labels captured by the agent. Labels and logs add valuable contextual information to your APM traces.</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltb11888816b7654a2/63504daf1d78fa218f251d72/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-6.png\" height=\"auto\"/></p><p>That’s really all it takes to do a custom instrumentation — easy yet powerful! For more details, see the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/js-base/current/api.html\" target=\"_self\">API documentation</a>.</p><h3>User experience dashboard</h3><p>Elastic APM offers a curated APM UI and built-in APM dashboards to visualize all the APM data captured by the agents out of the box.</p><p>You can also create your own custom visualizations in Elastic using <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/server/current/configuring-ingest-node.html\" target=\"_self\">ingest node pipelines</a> to enrich and transform your APM data. For example, the user IP and user agent data captured by the RUM agent represent very rich information about your customers. With all the information of user IP and user agent, it’s possible to create a visualization like this to show where the web traffic comes from on a map and what operating systems and browsers your customers are using.</p><p>However, many of the user data of interest could be present in the User Experience Dashboard visible in Elastic Observability. Sample visualizations are presented below:</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt7555ce1a42a4a337/63504e72dcd7cf2a10750b49/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-7.png\" height=\"auto\"/></p><h2>See the big picture with distributed tracing</h2><p>As a bonus point, we will also instrument our backend Spring Boot application so that you have a complete view of the overall transaction from the web browser all the way to the backend database, all in one view. Elastic APM distributed tracing enables you to do so.</p><h3>Configuring distributed tracing in RUM agents</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/js-base/current/distributed-tracing-guide.html\" target=\"_self\">Distributed tracing</a> is enabled by default in the RUM agent. However, it only includes requests made to the same origin. In order to include cross-origin requests, you must set the distributedTracingOrigins configuration option. You will also have to set the CORS policy in the backend application, as we will discuss in the next section.</p><p>For our application, the frontend is served from <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\" target=\"_self\">http://localhost:3000</a>. To include requests made to http://localhost:8080, we need to add the distributedtracingOrigins configuration to our React application. This is done inside rum.js. The code is already there. Simply uncommenting the line will do.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">var apm = initApm({<br/>  ...<br/>  distributedTracingOrigins: ['http://localhost:8080']<br/>})<br/></pre><p><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/8.4/distributed-tracing.html#w3c-tracecontext\" target=\"_self\">New agent versions</a> implement the W3C Trace Context specification and traceparent header to requests made to http://localhost:8080. However, note that previously this was achieved by adding the custom header elastic-apm-traceparent to these requests.</p><p>As per the latest version documentation, the server side instrumentation can be configured in three possible ways:</p><ol><li>Automatic attaching to the running JVM using the <strong>apm-agent-attach-cli.jar</strong></li><li>Programmatic setup using the <strong>apm-agent-attach</strong>, which requires a code change to your Java application</li><li>Manual setup using the <strong>-javaagent</strong> flag, as we shall do in the subsequent example</li></ol><p>To use the manual instrumentation approach on the server side, you need to <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:co.elastic.apm%20AND%20a:apm-agent-api\" target=\"_self\">download</a> the Java agent and start your application with it. In your favorite IDE, you will need to add the below vmArgs to the launch configuration.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">-javaagent:apm/wrapper/elastic-apm-agent-1.33.0.jar <br/>-Delastic.apm.service_name=cardatabase <br/>-Delastic.apm.application_packages=com.packt.cardatabase<br/>-Delastic.apm.server_urls=&lt;YOUR_APM_ENDPOINT&gt; <br/>-Delastic.apm.secret_token=&lt;YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN&gt;<br/></pre><p></p><p>If you are using Elastic Cloud, full configuration for both the RUM and APM agents can be found in the APM Integration of your deployment, a sample of which is visible below.</p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt0fb070fa4f93a460/635050b0ad35ab2389acc989/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-8.png\" height=\"auto\"/><p></p><p>Where the agents are configured will depend on your IDE of choice. The below screenshot is of my VSCode launch configuration for the Spring Boot application:</p><img height=\"auto\" src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt9c52c3334a613da2/635050e70528631ea56813fb/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-9.png\" width=\"727\" max-width=\"727\" style=\"width: 727px; height: auto;\"/><p></p><p>Now, refresh your car list from the browser to generate another request. Go to the Kibana APM UI and check the last “car list” page load. You should see a full trace including Java method invocations, similar to the following screenshot:</p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf5331328f1218b47/63505112b0662c1e9a674687/blog-elastic-RUMAPM-10.png\" height=\"auto\"/><p></p><p>As you can see, your client-side performance data from the browser and your server-side performance data, including JDBC access, all show up nicely in one distributed trace. Notice different colors for different parts of the distributed trace. Keep in mind this is the default tracing you get, without having to do any custom instrumentation on the server side, other than starting your application with the agent. Feel the power of Elastic APM and distributed tracing!</p><p>For readers who are really paying attention to the timeline visualization above, you might be wondering why the “Car List” page-load transaction ends at 193 ms, which is the <strong>domInteractive</strong> time, while data is still being served from the backend. Great question! This is due to the fact that the fetch calls are async by default. The browser “thinks” it finished parsing all the HTML and DOM construction is complete at 193 ms because it loaded all the “static” HTML contents served from the web server. On the other hand, React is still loading data from the backend server asynchronously.</p><h3>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</h3><p>The RUM agent is only one piece of the puzzle in a distributed trace. In order to use distributed tracing, we need to properly configure other components, too. One of the things that you will normally have to configure is cross-origin resource sharing, the “notorious” CORS! This is because the frontend and the backend services are typically deployed separately. With the <em><strong>same-origin</strong></em> policy, your frontend requests from a different origin to the backend will fail without properly configured CORS. Basically, CORS is a way for the server side to check if requests coming in from a different origin are allowed. To read more about cross-origin requests and why this process is necessary, please see the MDN page on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\" target=\"_self\">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>.</p><p>What does that mean for us? It means two things:</p><ol><li>We must set the distributedTracingOrigins configuration option, as we have done.</li><li>With that configuration, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/rum-js/current/distributed-tracing-guide.html#server-configuration\" target=\"_self\">the RUM agent also sends an HTTP OPTIONS request before the real HTTP request to make sure all the headers and HTTP methods are supported and the origin is allowed</a>. Specifically, http://localhost:8080 will receive an <strong>OPTIONS</strong> request with the following headers:<br/><pre class=\"prettyprint\">Access-Control-Request-Headers: traceparent, tracestate<br/>Access-Control-Request-Method: [request-method]<br/>Origin: [request-origin]<br/></pre>And APM server should respond to it with these headers and a 200 status code:<br/><pre class=\"prettyprint\">Access-Control-Allow-Headers: traceparent, tracestate<br/>Access-Control-Allow-Methods: [allowed-methods]<br/>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [request-origin]<br/></pre></li></ol><p>The MyCorsConfiguration class in our Spring Boot application does exactly that. There are different ways of configuring Spring Boot to do this, but here we are using a filter based approach. It’s configuring our server-side Spring Boot application to allow requests from any origin with any HTTP headers and any HTTP methods. You may not want to be this open with your production applications.</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">@Configuration<br/>public class MyCorsConfiguration {<br/>    @Bean<br/>    public FilterRegistrationBean&lt;CorsFilter&gt; corsFilter() {<br/>        UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();<br/>        CorsConfiguration config = new CorsConfiguration();<br/>        config.setAllowCredentials(true);<br/>        config.addAllowedOrigin(\"*\");<br/>        config.addAllowedHeader(\"*\");<br/>        config.addAllowedMethod(\"*\");<br/>        source.registerCorsConfiguration(\"/**\", config);<br/>        FilterRegistrationBean&lt;CorsFilter&gt; bean = new FilterRegistrationBean&lt;CorsFilter&gt;(new CorsFilter(source));<br/>        bean.setOrder(0);<br/>        return bean;<br/>    }<br/>}<br/></pre><h2>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, this blog made it clear that instrumenting your applications with Elastic RUM is simple and easy, yet extremely powerful. Together with other APM agents for backend services, RUM gives you a holistic view of application performance from an end-user perspective through distributed tracing.</p><p>Once again, to get started with Elastic APM, you can download <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/downloads/apm\" target=\"_self\">Elastic APM server</a> to run it locally, or create an <a href=\"https://cloud.elastic.co\" target=\"_self\">Elastic Cloud</a> trial account and have a cluster ready in a few minutes.</p><p>As always, reach out on the <a href=\"https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm\" target=\"_self\">Elastic APM forum</a> if you want to open up a discussion or have any questions.

style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);\"></span>Elasticsearch is a very versatile platform that supports a variety of use cases and provides great flexibility around data organisation and replication strategies. This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time. The more data the cluster holds, the more difficult it also becomes to correct the problem, as reindexing of large amounts of data can sometimes be required.</p><p>When we come across users that are experiencing performance problems, it is not uncommon that this can be traced back to issues around how data is indexed and number of shards in the cluster. This is especially true for use-cases involving multi-tenancy and/or use of time-based indices. When discussing this with users, either in person at events or meetings or via our <a href=\"https://discuss.elastic.co\" target=\"_self\">forum</a>, some of the most common questions are “How many shards should I have?” and “How large should my shards be?”</p><p>This blog post aims to help you answer these questions and provide practical guidelines for use cases that involve the use of time-based indices (e.g., logging or security analytics) in a single place.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is a shard?</h2><p>Before we start, we need to establish some facts and terminology that we will need in later sections.</p><p>Data in Elasticsearch is organized into <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/_add_an_index.html\" target=\"_self\">indices</a>. Each index is made up of one or more shards. Each shard is an instance of a Lucene index, which you can think of as a self-contained search engine that indexes and handles queries for a subset of the data in an Elasticsearch cluster.</p><p>As data is written to a shard, it is periodically published into new immutable Lucene segments on disk, and it is at this time it becomes available for querying. This is referred to as a refresh. How this works is described in greater detail in <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/inside-a-shard.html\" target=\"_self\">Elasticsearch: the Definitive Guide</a>.</p><p>As the number of segments grow, these are periodically consolidated into larger segments. This process is referred to as <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/index-modules-merge.html\" target=\"_self\">merging</a>. As all segments are immutable, this means that the disk space used will typically fluctuate during indexing, as new, merged segments need to be created before the ones they replace can be deleted. Merging can be quite resource intensive, especially with respect to disk I/O.</p><p>The shard is the unit at which Elasticsearch distributes data around the cluster. The speed at which Elasticsearch can move shards around when rebalancing data, e.g. following a failure, will depend on the size and number of shards as well as network and disk performance.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\"><em>TIP:</em></span><span style=\"font-weight: 700;\"><em>&nbsp;</em></span><span style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"><em></em></span><em>Avoid having very large shards as this can negatively affect the cluster's ability to recover from failure. There is no fixed limit on how large shards can be, but a shard size of 50GB is often quoted as a limit that has been seen to work for a variety of use-cases.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Index by retention period</h2><p>As segments are immutable, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/update-doc.html\" target=\"_self\">updating a document</a> requires Elasticsearch to first find the existing document, then mark it as deleted and add the updated version. <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/delete-doc.html\" target=\"_self\">Deleting a document</a> also requires the document to be found and marked as deleted. For this reason, deleted documents <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/lucenes-handling-of-deleted-documents\" target=\"_self\">will continue to tie up disk space and some system resources until they are merged out</a>, which can consume a lot of system resources.</p><p>Elasticsearch allows complete indices to be deleted very efficiently directly from the file system, without explicitly having to delete all records individually. This is by far the most efficient way to delete data from Elasticsearch.</p><hr/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>Try to use </em><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/time-based.html\" target=\"_self\"><em>time-based indices</em></a><em> for managing data retention whenever possible. Group data into indices based on the retention period. Time-based indices also make it easy to vary the number of primary shards and replicas over time, as this can be changed for the next index to be generated. This simplifies adapting to changing data volumes and requirements.</em></p><hr/><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Are indices and shards not free?</h2><p>For each Elasticsearch index, information about mappings and state is stored in the cluster state. This is kept in memory for fast access. Having a large number of indices and shards in a cluster can therefore result in a large cluster state, especially if mappings are large. This can become slow to update as all updates need to be done through a single thread in order to guarantee consistency before the changes are distributed across the cluster.</p><hr/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>In order to reduce the number of indices and avoid large and sprawling mappings, consider storing data with similar structure in the same index rather than splitting into separate indices based on where the data comes from. It is important to find a good balance between the number of indices and shards, and the mapping size for each individual index. Because the </em><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/finite-scale.html#finite-scale\" target=\"_blank\"><em>cluster state</em></a><em> is loaded into the heap on every node (including the masters), and the amount of heap is directly proportional to the number of indices, fields per index and shards, it is important to also monitor the heap usage on master nodes and make sure they are sized appropriately. &nbsp;</em></p><hr/><p>Each shard has data that need to be kept in memory and use heap space. This includes data structures holding information at the shard level, but also at the segment level in order to define where data reside on disk. The size of these data structures is not fixed and will vary depending on the use-case.</p><p>One important characteristic of the segment related overhead is however that it is not strictly proportional to the size of the segment. This means that larger segments have less overhead per data volume compared to smaller segments. The difference can be substantial.</p><p>In order to be able to store as much data as possible per node, it becomes important to manage heap usage and reduce the amount of overhead as much as possible. The more heap space a node has, the more data and shards it can handle.</p><p>Indices and shards are therefore not free from a cluster perspective, as there is some level of resource overhead for each index and shard.</p><hr/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>Small shards result in small segments, which increases overhead. Aim to keep the average shard size between at least a few GB and a few tens of GB. For use-cases with time-based data, it is common to see shards between 20GB and 40GB in size.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>As the overhead per shard depends on the segment count and size, forcing smaller segments to merge into larger ones through a </em><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/indices-forcemerge.html\" target=\"_self\"><em>forcemerge</em></a><em> operation can reduce overhead and improve query performance. This should ideally be done once no more data is written to the index. Be aware that this is an expensive operation that should ideally be performed during off-peak hours.</em></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>The number of shards you can hold on a node will be proportional to the amount of heap you have available, but there is no fixed limit enforced by Elasticsearch. A good rule-of-thumb is to ensure you keep the number of shards per node below 20 per GB heap it has configured. A node with a 30GB heap should therefore have a maximum of 600&nbsp;shards, but the further below this limit you can keep it the better. This will generally help the cluster stay in good health. </em><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);\"><em><strong>(Editor’s note: As of 8.3, we have drastically reduced the heap usage per shard, thus updating the rule of thumb in this blog. Please follow TIP below for 8.3+ versions of Elasticsearch.)</strong></em></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>NEW TIP: </strong></em><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);\"><em><strong>Allow 1kB of heap per field per index on data nodes, plus overheads</strong></em><em><strong><br/></strong></em></span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);\"><em>The exact resource usage of each mapped field depends on its type, but a rule of thumb is to allow for approximately 1kB of heap overhead per mapped field per index held by each data node. You must also allow enough heap for Elasticsearch’s baseline usage as well as your workload, such as indexing, searches, and aggregations. Extra heap of 0.5GB will suffice for many reasonable workloads, and you may need even less if your workload is very light while heavy workloads may require more.</em></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);\"><em>For example, if a data node holds shards from 1000 indices, each containing 4000 mapped fields, then you should allow approximately 1000 × 4000 × 1kB = 4GB of heap for the fields and another 0.5GB of heap for its workload and other overheads, and therefore this node will need a heap size of at least 4.5GB.</em></span><span style=\"color: rgb(52, 55, 65);\"><em><strong></strong></em></span></p><hr/><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How does shard size affect performance?</h2><p>In Elasticsearch, each query is executed in a single thread per shard. Multiple shards can however be processed in parallel, as can multiple queries and aggregations against the same shard.</p><p>This means that the minimum query latency, when no caching is involved, will depend on the data, the type of query, as well as the size of the shard. Querying lots of small shards will make the processing per shard faster, but as many more tasks need to be queued up and processed in sequence, it is not necessarily going to be faster than querying a smaller number of larger shards. Having lots of small shards can also reduce the query throughput if there are multiple concurrent queries.</p><hr/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>The best way to determine the maximum shard size from a query performance perspective is to </em><a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/conf/2016/sf/quantitative-cluster-sizing\" target=\"_self\"><em>benchmark using realistic data and queries</em></a><em>. Always benchmark with a query and indexing load representative of what the node would need to handle in production, as optimizing for a single query might give misleading results.</em></p><hr/><h2 dir=\"ltr\">How do I manage shard size?</h2><p>When using time-based indices, each index has traditionally been associated with a fixed time period. Daily indices are very common, and often used for holding data with short retention period or large daily volumes. These allow retention period to be managed with good granularity and makes it easy to adjust for changing volumes on a daily basis. Data with a longer retention period, especially if the daily volumes do not warrant the use of daily indices, often use weekly or monthly indices in order to keep the shard size up. This reduces the number of indices and shards that need to be stored in the cluster over time.</p><hr/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>TIP: If using time-based indices covering a fixed period, adjust the period each index covers based on the retention period and expected data volumes in order to reach the target shard size.</em></p><hr/><p>Time-based indices with a fixed time interval works well when data volumes are reasonably predictable and change slowly. If the indexing rate can vary quickly, it is very difficult to maintain a uniform target shard size.</p><p>In order to be able to better handle this type of scenarios, the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/managing-time-based-indices-efficiently\" target=\"_self\">Rollover and Shrink APIs</a> were introduced. These add a lot of flexibility to how indices and shards are managed, specifically for time-based indices.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/indices-rollover-index.html\" target=\"_self\">rollover index API</a> makes it possible to specify the number of documents an index should contain and/or the maximum period documents should be written to it. Once one of these criteria has been exceeded, Elasticsearch can trigger a new index to be created for writing without downtime. Instead of having each index cover a specific time-period, it is now possible to switch to a new index at a specific size, which makes it possible to more easily achieve an even shard size for all indices.</p><p>In cases where data might be updated, there is no longer a distinct link between the timestamp of the event and the index it resides in when using this API, which may make updates significantly less efficient as each update may need to be preceded by a search.</p><hr/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>If you have time-based, immutable data where volumes can vary significantly over time, consider using the rollover index API to achieve an optimal target shard size by dynamically varying the time-period each index covers. This gives great flexibility and can help avoid having too large or too small shards when volumes are unpredictable.</em><br/></p><hr/><p>The <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/indices-shrink-index.html\" target=\"_self\">shrink index API</a> allows you to shrink an existing index into a new index with fewer primary shards. If an even spread of shards across nodes is desired during indexing, but this will result in too small shards, this API can be used to reduce the number of primary shards once the index is no longer indexed into. This will result in larger shards, better suited for longer term storage of data.<br/></p><hr/><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em><strong>TIP: </strong></em><em>If you need to have each index cover a specific time period but still want to be able to spread indexing out across a large number of nodes, consider using the shrink API to reduce the number of primary shards once the index is no longer indexed into. This API can also be used to reduce the number of shards in case you have initially configured too many shards.</em><br/></p><hr/><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Conclusions</h2><p>This blog post has provided tips and practical guidelines around how to best manage data in Elasticsearch.

It's natural to ask “hmm, is there an academic paper that addresses this?” Other times, academic work is a source of inspiration.

But implementing them can be intimidating and error-prone — algorithm descriptions are often complex, with important practical details omitted. And testing is a real challenge: for example, how can we thoroughly test a machine learning algorithm whose output depends closely on the dataset?\n</p><p>This post shares strategies for implementing academic papers in a software application. It draws on examples from Elasticsearch and Lucene in hopes of helping other engineers learn from our experiences. You might read these strategies and think “but this is just software development!” And that would indeed be true: as engineers we already have the right practices and tools, they just need to be adapted to a new challenge.\n</p><h2>Evaluate the paper as you would a software dependency</h2><p>Adding a new software dependency requires careful evaluation: if the other package is incorrect, slow, or insecure, our project could be too. Before pulling in a dependency, developers make sure to evaluate its quality.\n</p><p>The same applies to academic papers you're considering implementing. It may seem that because an algorithm was published in a paper, it must be correct and perform well. But even though it passed a review process, an academic paper can have issues. Maybe the correctness proof relies on assumptions that aren't realistic. Or perhaps the “experiments” section shows much better performance than the baseline, but this only holds on a specific dataset. Even if the paper is of great quality, its approach may not be a good fit for your project.\n</p><p>When thinking about whether to take a “dependency” on an academic paper, it's helpful to ask the same questions we would of a software package:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Is the library widely-used and “battle tested”? → Have other packages implemented this paper, and has it worked well for them?</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Are performance benchmarks available? Do these seem accurate and fair? → Does the paper include realistic experiments? Are they well designed?</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Is a performance improvement big enough to justify the complexity? → Does the paper compare to a strong baseline approach? How much does it outperform this baseline?</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Will the approach integrate well with our system? → Do the algorithm's assumptions and trade-offs fit our use case?</li>\n</ul><p>Somehow when a software package publishes a performance comparison against their competitors, the package always comes out fastest! If a third party designed the benchmarks, they may be more balanced. The same phenomenon applies to academic papers. If an algorithm performs well not only in the original paper, but also appears in other papers as a strong baseline, then it is very likely to be solid.\n</p><h2>Get creative with testing</h2><p>Algorithms from academic papers often have more sophisticated behavior than the types of algorithms we routinely encounter. Perhaps it's an approximation algorithm that trades off accuracy for better speed. Or maybe it's a machine learning method that takes in a large dataset, and produces (sometimes unexpected) outputs. How can we write tests for these algorithms if we can't characterize their behavior in a simple way?\n</p><h3>Focus on invariants</h3><p>When designing unit tests, it's common to think in terms of examples: if we give the algorithm this example input, it should have that output. Unfortunately for most mathematical algorithms, example-based testing doesn't sufficiently cover their behavior.\n</p><p>Let's consider the C3 algorithm, which Elasticsearch uses to figure out what node should handle a search request. It ranks each node using a nuanced formula that incorporates the node's previous service and response times, and its queue size. Testing a couple examples doesn't really verify we understood the formula correctly. It helps to step back and think about testing invariants: if service time increases, does the node's rank decrease? If the queue size is 0, is the rank determined by response time, as the paper claims?\n</p><p>Focusing on invariants can help in a number of common cases:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Is the method supposed to be order-agnostic? If so, passing the input data in a different order should result in the same output.</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Does some step in the algorithm produce class probabilities? If so, these probabilities should sum to 1.</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Is the function symmetric around the origin? If so, flipping the sign of the input should simply flip the sign of the output.</li>\n</ul><p>When we first implemented C3, we had a bug in the formula where we accidentally used the inverse of response time in place of response time. This meant slower nodes could be ranked higher! When fixing the issue, we <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/70283\">made sure to add invariant checks</a> to guard against future mistakes.\n</p><h3>Compare to a reference implementation</h3><p>Alongside the paper, the authors hopefully published an implementation of the algorithm. (This is especially likely if the paper contains experiments, as many journals require authors to post code for reproducing the results.) You can test your approach against this reference implementation to make sure you haven't missed important details of the algorithm.\n</p><p>While developing Lucene's HNSW implementation for nearest-neighbor search, we <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9937\">tested against a reference library</a> by the paper's authors. We ran both Lucene and the library against the same dataset, comparing the accuracy of their results and the number of computations they performed. When these numbers match closely, we know that Lucene faithfully implements the algorithm.\n</p><p>When incorporating an algorithm into a system, you often need to make modifications or extensions, like scaling it to multiple cores, or adding heuristics to improve performance. It's best to first implement a \"vanilla\" version, test it against the reference, then make incremental changes. That way you can be confident you've captured all the key parts before making customizations.\n</p><h3>Duel against an existing algorithm</h3><p>The last section raises another idea for a test invariant: comparing the algorithm's output to a simpler and better-understood algorithm's output. As an example, consider the block-max WAND algorithm in Lucene, which speeds up document retrieval by skipping over documents that can't appear in the top results. It is difficult to describe exactly how block-max WAND should behave in every case, but we do know that applying it shouldn't change the top results! So our tests can generate several random search queries, then <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/lucene/blob/main/lucene/core/src/test/org/apache/lucene/search/TestWANDScorer.java#L669\">run them both with and without the WAND optimization</a> and check that their results always match.\n</p><p>An important aspect of these tests is that they <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-testing-qa-increasing-coverage-randomizing-test-runs\">generate random inputs</a> on which to run the comparison. This can help exercise cases you wouldn't have thought of, and surface unexpected issues. As an example, Lucene's randomized comparison test for BM25F scoring has helped<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-10039\"> catch bugs in subtle edge cases</a>. The idea of feeding an algorithm random inputs is closely related to the concept of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing\"> fuzzing</a>, a common testing technique in computer security.\n</p><p>Elasticsearch and Lucene frequently use this testing approach. If you see a test that mentions a \"duel\" between two algorithms (TestDuelingAnalyzers, testDuelTermsQuery...), then you know this strategy is in action.\n</p><h2>Use the paper's terminology</h2><p>When another developer works with your code, they'll need to consult the paper to follow its details. The<a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/4f22f437ee50cacb94b37b457be1da0b8ba0e8ce/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/search/aggregations/metrics/HyperLogLogPlusPlus.java#L24-L39\"> comment on Elasticsearch's HyperLogLog++ implementation</a> says it well: “Trying to understand what this class does without having read the paper is considered adventurous.” This method comment also sets a good example. It includes a link to the academic paper, and highlights what modifications were made to the algorithm as it was originally described.\n</p><p>Since developers will base their understanding of the code on the paper, it's helpful to use the exact same terminology. Since mathematical notation is terse, this can result in names that would not usually be considered “good style”, but are very clear in the context of the paper. Formulas from academic papers are one of the few times you'll encounter cryptic variable names in Elasticsearch like<a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/4f22f437ee50cacb94b37b457be1da0b8ba0e8ce/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/node/ResponseCollectorService.java#L151\"> rS and muBarSInverse</a>.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt83d9ad71c909c603/6154b0ac58e1f54c5cbc48f2/elastic-blog-academicpaper.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt83d9ad71c909c603\" alt=\"elastic-blog-academicpaper.jpg\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0dab3aab-7fff-4f7f-8b92-e1500e9e915e\"><br><em>The author's recommended way of reading a paper: with a large coffee.</em></span></p><h2>You can email the author</h2><p>When working through a tough paper, you may spend hours puzzling over a formula, unsure if you're misunderstanding or if there's just a typo. If this were an open source project, you could ask a question on GitHub or StackOverflow. But where can you turn for an academic paper? The authors seem busy and might be annoyed by your emails.\n</p><p>On the contrary, many academics love hearing that their ideas are being put into practice and are happy to answer questions over email. If you work on a product they're familiar with, they might even list the application on their website!\n</p><p>There's also a growing trend for academics to discuss papers in the open, using many of the same tools from software development. If a paper has an accompanying software package, you might find answers to<a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/1928\"> common questions on Github</a>. Stack Exchange communities like “Theoretical Computer Science” and “Cross Validated” also contain<a href=\"https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/49296/problem-in-the-paper-stable-minimum-space-partitioning-in-linear-time\"> detailed discussions about popular papers</a>. Some conferences have begun to publish all paper reviews online. These reviews contain<a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eA7AEtvS\"> back-and-forth discussions</a> with the authors that can surface helpful insights about the approach.\n</p><h2>To be continued</h2><p>This post focuses on the basics of choosing an academic paper and implementing it correctly, but doesn't cover all aspects of actually deploying the algorithm. For example, if the algorithm is just one component in a complex system, how do we ensure that changes to the component lead to end-to-end improvements? And what if integrating the algorithm requires substantial modifications or extensions that the original paper doesn't cover? These are important topics we hope to share more about in future posts.\n</p>","PublishedAt":"2021-09-30 01:00:00+00:00","OriginURL":"https://www.elastic.co/blog/implementing-academic-papers-lessons-learned-from-elasticsearch-and-lucene","SourceName":"Elastic"}},{"node":{"ID":62,"Title":"Elastic on Elastic: Configuring the Security app to use Cross Cluster Search","Description":"<p>The Elastic Infosec Detections and Analytics team is responsible for building, tuning, and maintaining the security detections used to protect all Elastic systems. Within Elastic we call ourselves Customer Zero and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-on-elastic-how-infosec-deploys-infrastructure-and-stays-up-to-date-with-eck\">we strive to always use the newest versions</a> of our products.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>In the previous blog posts we gave an overview of our architecture and what data we send to our clusters. In this blog post we will provide instructions on how we use Cross Cluster Search (CCS) with the Security and Machine Learning (ML) applications\n</p>\n<h2>Configuring CCS<br></h2>\n<p>Getting the Security app to work with CCS only requires a few minor changes. The first step is to configure the Security app so that it knows to look for the CCS index patterns instead of local index patterns. To do this open the Kibana ‘Advanced Settings’ within the Stack Management menu, then located within the Security Solution section update the Elasticsearch indices. These should be set to match the CCS index patterns such as *:auditbeat-*, *:filebeat-*, *:logs-*, and any other index patterns you want to add to your Security app.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kxD1eOYM7-2VRGKIc0PAkZgUV3cvNg6bSSgcYv-i5HQox3VLEgQXNDSxbS9sgqNfDT_AhbvWuZcEfQA_OJxi68lEsQZIJY7w15EwoM4e2uFdnyAoBnGS3O3-cudSiz1pU4H-CPvy=s0\" width=\"602\" height=\"249\">\n</p>\n<p>Now when you return to the Security app you should see the Overview, Hosts, and Network pages displaying events from all of your remote clusters.\n</p>\n<h2>Configuring Built In Detection Rules to use CCS</h2>\n<p>Creating brand new custom Detection rules does not require any additional steps, the CCS index patterns will be available to select when you create a new detection rule. If you want to use the 500+ built in Detection rules with CCS it requires a little extra work. To do this you will need to import, duplicate, and bulk edit all of the rules to change the index patterns to use Cross Cluster Search.&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p>The first step is to load all of the pre-built Elastic rules into your Security App. Within the detections tab of the security app navigate to the ‘Manage Detections’ page and click the ‘Load Elastic prebuilt rules’ button.\n</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height:1.38;background-color:#ffffff;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;padding:18pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UolDnHQhugxnjt3-eXvkWouN6ttWFaJsA0G_PYBCAqcL5qXKHu8-sEjvXWtR4LysIiuiAwoGqwdJzWkXzhyaKNhNfLo77bqS9J3TpjmoDkJO5dKYTjKD3io9KZ0jt4Sa5vmowWOl=s0\" width=\"266\" height=\"65\"></h2>\n<p>The Prebuilt rules can not be directly modified but they can be duplicated and then the duplicates can be modified. To do this you will need to select all of the rules and use the ‘Bulk Actions’ menu to duplicate them all. Before starting this process I recommend changing the ‘refresh settings’ to disable automatically refreshing the table. If you don’t then the table may refresh automatically while you are trying to duplicate the rules causing you to deselect some rules.\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/b6A0AsuACM2hHZ1nDmCklF09TdWKmfoQoUPC-35sKP7mDNN2I3Gnl4O-n8R5nQNL2ldEeLSNuyLpyV6GZFpXDW9P3S5vc3n79sxV9Lsu1cuNRsJPViO_mcHy4rz_W2cY9sZP2v31=s0\" width=\"216\" height=\"77\">\n</p>\n<p>To Select all rules on clusters older than 7.14 you will need to change the ‘Rows per page’ to the maximum amount. <br>\n</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height:1.38;background-color:#ffffff;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;padding:18pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;\" rel=\"line-height:1.38;background-color:#ffffff;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;padding:18pt 0pt 6pt 0pt;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/THYRjUpwmz2qiAWpp780ZtW_SrQ_3rO3bnPlj67rC4uhbGCzDzzUNJ9aewX29WsZUqa5LTihcGefyLbus8L47PuXWHoezF9Ctqg7yZBcQToWSq6SP4CpLc3bGTZa20jvp2LsdLnw=s0\" width=\"192\" height=\"464\"></h2>\n<p>When all of the rules are displayed select all rules and then in the bulk actions menu select ‘Duplicate Selected’.

For example, to use the remote auditbeat index pattern you will need to find \"auditbeat-*\" and replace it with \"*:auditbeat-*\".&nbsp; Repeat this for the other index patterns until all of the index patterns have been changed to the new CCS pattern.<br><br>\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SjH1dydxRimjXQP5NGTeRdaQnrCWgZUCcO-g4O5qZCUhKLcKKzbv_LqIgtv55gU2TbjnJg13wta5hM26e7UTI4FoJZOI3XCtiXgfqIcN49tTPFvnpRmrHQPkq3jOrIDZFamCOAw4=s0\" width=\"375\" height=\"76\">\n</p>\n<p>I also recommend replacing the word ‘[Duplicate]’ that was appended to every rule name with the current stack version. This will help you manage your rules over time and track when each rule was installed or last updated.\n</p>\n<p>After all of the changes have been saved to the custom rules ndjson file you can import the modified rules over the existing rules. Click the ‘Import rule’ button to open the rule import interface\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LlSpXbKOK9bvQRIJcp27-vmCAm2NcJJoQFZwY8JiuQ3KqMQghZt6D2ldD10dfExemIhIsMUDtlkEN-X8cWWh94PmxIN6CnjYiDWSWe7ercmrZT6sTjuTw1OwOdokPiEAlvLjWWVK=s0\" width=\"592\" height=\"166\">\n</p>\n<p>Drag and drop the modified rule file to the pop up window and select the button to ‘Automatically overwrite saved objects with the same rule ID’.

Many of the built in Elastic detection rules use EQL so if you are using CCS with clusters older than 7.14 you will need to disable those rules.<br><br>\n</p>\n<h2>Machine Learning with CCS</h2>\n<p>To use the Machine Learning with CCS you will need to update each of the datafeeds to use the CCS index patterns. When creating your own custom Machine Learning jobs this is easy to do, you simply select the CCS index pattern when creating the new job. To use the built in Security Machine Learning jobs requires modifying the datafeeds of each job to use the CCS index patterns. Because you cannot change a datafeed’s index pattern via the UI, doing this requires access to the Kibana Devtools or API access. My method for doing this is to load the built-in Machine Learning jobs, stop all of the jobs, and then use the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-apis.html\">Machine Learning API</a> to <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-get-datafeed.html\">Get the datafeed</a>, make the change to the datafeed’s Index pattern, and then <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ml-update-datafeed.html\">update the datafeed</a> with the changes. After this is complete all of the ML jobs and datafeeds can be restarted. If you used the built in Security ML jobs you can now enable the built in Detection rules that use Machine Learning.<br>\n</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this post we showed you how to configure your Security Application and Machine Learning jobs to work with Cross Cluster Search.

Now developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and security analysts can ingest data from Google Pub/Sub to the Elastic Stack with just a few clicks in the Google Cloud Console. By leveraging Google Dataflow templates, Elastic makes it easy to stream events and logs from Google Cloud services like Google Cloud Audit, VPC Flow, or firewall into the Elastic Stack. This allows customers to simplify their data pipeline architecture, eliminate operational overhead, and reduce the time required for troubleshooting. </p><p>Many developers, SREs, and security analysts who use Google Cloud to develop applications and set up their infrastructure also use the Elastic Stack to troubleshoot, monitor, and identify security anomalies. Google and Elastic have worked together to provide an easy-to-use, frictionless way to ingest logs and events from applications and infrastructure in Google Cloud services to Elastic. And all of this is possible with just a few clicks in the Google Cloud Console, without ever installing any data shippers.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In this blog post, we’ll cover how to get started with agentless data ingestion from Google Pub/Sub to the Elastic Stack using Google Dataflow. </p><h2>Skip the overhead</h2><p>Pub/Sub is a popular serverless asynchronous messaging service used to stream data from Google Operations (formerly Stackdriver), applications built using Google Cloud services, or other use cases involving streaming data integration pipelines. Ingesting Google Cloud Audit, VPC Flow, or firewall logs to third-party analytics solutions like the Elastic Stack requires these logs to be shipped to Google Operations first, then Pub/Sub.&nbsp; Once the logs are in Pub/Sub, a Google Cloud user must decide on the ingestion method to ship messages stored in Google Pub/Sub to third-party analytics solutions. </p><p>A popular option for joint Google and Elastic users is to install Filebeat, Elastic Agent, or Fluentd on a Google Compute Engine VM (virtual machine), then use one of these data shippers to send data from Pub/Sub to the Elastic Stack. Provisioning a VM and installing data shippers requires process and management overhead. The ability to skip this step and ingest data directly from Pub/Sub to Elastic is valuable to many users — especially when&nbsp; it can be done with a few clicks in the Google Cloud Console. Now this is possible through a dropdown menu in Google Dataflow. </p><h2>Streamline data ingest</h2><p>Google Dataflow is a serverless asynchronous messaging service based on Apache Beam. Dataflow can be used instead of Filebeat to ship logs directly from the Google Cloud Console. The Google and Elastic teams worked together to develop an out-of-the-box Dataflow template that pushes logs and events from Pub/Sub to Elastic. This template replaces lightweight processing such as data format transformation previously completed by Filebeat in a serverless manner — with no other changes for users who previously used the Elasticsearch ingest pipeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Here is a summary of data ingestion flow.

Additionally, any custom OTel instrumentation you add to your application will be picked up by our agent. </p> <p>We are initially providing auto instrumentation of following: </p> <ul> <li aria-level=\"1\">URLSession</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">CPU & Memory usage</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Network connectivity</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">Device & Application attributes</li> </ul> <p>Our main focus is to provide insight into your backend services from the perspective of your mobile application, automatically displaying distributed traces starting at your mobile app. </p> <strong><h2>Downloading the agent</h2></strong> <p>The agent will initially be provided through the <a href=\"https://swift.org/package-manager/\">Swift Package Manager</a>. It can be added to an iOS project through the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app\">Xcode SPM dependency manager</a> or through a <code>Package.swift</code> file.&nbsp; </p> <p>Simply add the following to your Package.swift dependencies </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">         dependencies: [ \n        .package(name: \"apm-agent-ios\", url: \"https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-ios\", .branch(“v0.1.0\")), \n… </pre> <p>And add “iOSAgent” to the targets you wish to instrument: </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">.target( \n            name: \"MyLibrary\", \n            dependencies: [ \n                .product(name: \"iOSAgent\", package: \"apm-agent-ios\") \n            ]), </pre> <strong><h2>The agent API</h2></strong> <p>The Elastic APM iOS Agent has a few project requirements: </p> <ul> <li aria-level=\"1\">It’s only compatible with Swift (sorry Objective-C engineers)&nbsp;</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">It requires Swift v5.3</li> <li aria-level=\"1\">It requires the minimum of iOS v11</li> </ul> <p>The agent API is fairly slim. We provide a configuration object that allows the agent to be set up for an on-prem or cloud solution. </p> <p>If you’re using SwiftUI to build your app, you can set up the agent as follows:&nbsp; </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">struct MyApp: App { \n    init() { \n        var config = AgentConfiguration() \n        config.collectorAddress = \"127.0.0.1\"  \n        config.collectorPort = 8200  \n        config.collectorTLS = false  \n        config.secretToken = \"&lt;secret token&gt;\"  \n        Agent.start(with: config) \n    } </pre> <p>&nbsp;Read up more on configuration in the “<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/swift/0.x/setup.html\">Set up the Agent</a>” doc. </p> <p>The agent also captures any data recorded through the OpenTelementry-Swift APIs, including traces and metrics. Here’s an example on how to start a simple trace: </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">let instrumentationLibraryName = \"SimpleExporter\" \nlet instrumentationLibraryVersion = \"semver:0.1.0\" \nvar instrumentationLibraryInfo = InstrumentationLibraryInfo(name: instrumentationLibraryName, version: instrumentationLibraryVersion) \nvar tracer = OpenTelemetrySDK.instance.tracerProvider.get(instrumentationName: instrumentationLibraryName, instrumentationVersion: instrumentationLibraryVersion) as! TracerSdk \nfunc simpleSpan() { \n    let span = tracer.spanBuilder(spanName: \"SimpleSpan\").setSpanKind(spanKind: .client).startSpan() \n    span.setAttribute(key: sampleKey, value: sampleValue) \n    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.5) \n    span.end() \n} </pre> <p>You can find more examples on how to use the OTel API at <a href=\"https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-swift/tree/main/Examples\">OpenTelementry-Swift examples</a>. </p> <p>If you decide to go this route, you may have to add OpenTelemetry-Swift as a dependency to your project as well.&nbsp; </p> <strong><h2>Summary and future</h2></strong> <p>We would be thrilled to receive your feedback in our <a href=\"https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm\">discussion forum</a> or in <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/apm-agent-ios\">our GitHub repository</a>. Please keep in mind that the current release is a preview and we may introduce breaking changes. We are excited to be launching this mobile offering and already have many ideas for what comes next, but we want the community to help guide our direction.

The aim is to improve the quality, speed and precision of how we collect and analyze large volumes of data connected to the industry — from declared fish hauls, harbor exit manifests, to GPS data tracking vessel locations.\n</p><p>The challenge we have is to provide up-to-date information that is verified, complete, dynamic and can be viewed in various formats depending on the target audience, and Elastic is the solution. Elastic handles ingesting all of our data and render visualizations to make it easy to share and use real-time information about commercial fishing activity. With this integrated data, we can take enforcement action, stop illegal fishing, and negotiate fishing rights with our neighboring countries.\n</p><h1 dir=\"ltr\">Why we choose Elastic over Splunk and Graylog</h1><p>The first stage of the project was to perform a proof of concept with a solution capable of storing, extracting, and presenting the data related to fishing activities in real time.\n</p><p>We benchmarked the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/\">Elastic Stack</a> against other tools, such as Graylog and Splunk. We were ultimately won over by the Elastic Stack’s speed and ease of use, along with its power and scalability. The data presentation and visualization tools, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/what-is/kibana-canvas\">Canvas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/kibana/\">Kibana</a>, have also played crucial roles in this project, enabling us to efficiently provide information for our end users in the context of increasingly strict protective fishing regulations and measures. In addition, our Elastic subscription, reduces our development time and allows us to focus on our real work, thanks to the support team at Elastic.\n</p><h1 dir=\"ltr\">Casting a wide regulatory fishing net with Elastic</h1><p>With GPS systems required on fishing vessels larger than 12 meters (39 feet), we have been able to track boats while at the same time indexing that monitoring data into <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/\">Elasticsearch</a>, where it is visualized in either Kibana or Canvas. This enables us to help Ministry officials on several enforcement levels:\n</p><ul>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Locating activity zones of boats and areas of intense fishing</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Monitoring fishing quotas in FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) zones&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\">Flagging infringements of the law</li>\n</ul><em><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltb97730e25592db6c/6164acc6ca79db05abb0f1ad/kibana-presentation-areas-intense-fishing.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltb97730e25592db6c\" alt=\"kibana-presentation-areas-intense-fishing.jpg\">\n</p>Sample Kibana presentation to locate areas of intense fishing&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></em><br><p>With Canvas, we can refine the granularity, quality, and format to ensure the fishery data is presented in the most suitable format for the audience, especially a non-technical audience.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf4ea8efa140c8790/6164ae0656faa61e63fdd9a9/infographic-quotas-de-peche.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltf4ea8efa140c8790\" alt=\"infographic-quotas-de-peche.png\"></p><p><em>Example of the infographics generated using Canvas to monitor fishing data of cod, sardine, and tuna\n\t</em>\n</p><p>We could not render presentations like this with our legacy tools, which were conventional databases and a Java application. They were at their limits in terms of the required performance due to the number of filter fields, 300 and counting. Now, once the data has been processed in Logstash, stored and indexed in Elasticsearch, it can be filtered, cross-referenced and correlated in real time.&nbsp;\n</p><p>Elastic gives us the ability to verify the precision and compliance of statements declared by boats compared with actual recorded events.\n</p><p>We are storing our raw data for 10 years. This amounts to 135 million records in Elasticsearch. In addition, each record contains more than 300 filter fields. We receive raw ERS (Electronic Reporting System) data in XML format, as issued by the boats using onboard software or GPS, and we model this data as it flows in so we can integrate it into our Elasticsearch cluster.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4a80668166d5428f/6164ae5edd1cf90b821de893/diagram-ers-data-xml-format-boats-gps-model.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt4a80668166d5428f\" alt=\"diagram-ers-data-xml-format-boats-gps-model.png\"></p><h1 dir=\"ltr\">How Elastic fits in the architectural layout of the French Ministry of Agriculture <br></h1><p>This sea of information allows us to pinpoint quantities and species fished, rejections of protected species, type of boat plus its flag, registration and equipment, fishing quotas per territorial area, satellite operator depending on the region of the globe, and much more.&nbsp;\n</p><p>Real-time information detailed by region is the basis for consolidated analyses and discussion to facilitate immediate remedying of any infringements of the law, rapid reaction to media controversy relating to protected marine species, and even the renegotiation of quotas each year within the European Union.\n</p><h1 dir=\"ltr\">Expanding to political, economical and environmental use cases&nbsp;</h1><p>The Ministry is continuing to closely monitor new releases of the Elastic Stack. We are anticipating the availability of a French version of Kibana, which would expand the solution’s user group. The most recent functionalities provided in versions 7.11 and 7.12 of Elastic are being tested with great interest — in particular the addition of the tracks layer in the Maps application. This feature takes an index of point locations, ordered by time, and displays them as a line, enabling us to track the route taken by boats, as shown below:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt1c263e15a3d96e4d/6164ac5daeba391136e44d0e/dashboard-test-trace.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt1c263e15a3d96e4d\" alt=\"dashboard-test-trace.jpg\">\n</p><p>We have been grateful for the ease of use, flexibility, and creativity of Kibana and Canvas in enabling stakeholders to remain well informed and to react rapidly to increasingly stringent protective regulations and measures. Moreover, the fishing data provided in XML format is modeled by batch, which enables requests to be processed via Elasticsearch on a continuously growing volume of data, without having to wait for all 10 years of the current stored data to be processed. Elastic also enables the indexation process to be repeated each time new data is added to existing fields.&nbsp;\n</p><p>In the short term, the Ministry’s aim is to conclude the roll-out of this solution and open it up to a growing group of users.\n</p><p>Beyond fishing data, we are going to need to store, process, and analyze increasing volumes of tracking data, particularly in regard to food — from farm to table. All of which means that Elastic could be of use for these new development projects with high political, economical and environmental stakes.\n</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><br>\n</p><hr><p><em><strong>Sébastien Arnaud</strong> — Exchanges & Data architect at the French Ministry of Agriculture</em>\n</p><p>Following initial training in the field of networks and IT security, he has worked on complex data exchange and transformation solutions.

The Elastic App Search web crawler, now generally available, makes implementing search and ingesting website content nearly effortless. In addition to a number of web crawler improvements that make setup a snap, like automatic crawling controls, content extraction tools, and the ability to natively analyze logs and metrics in Kibana, the web crawler now enables customers to use a single platform to search all of their organization’s data — even websites.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt1ce8388dee720102/613cdadbfbe3b8273005fc82/7-15-elastic-co-starting-a-crawl.gif\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt1ce8388dee720102\" alt=\"Generally available with Elastic 7.15, the Elastic App Search Web Crawler makes it easy to ingest website content\"><br>\n</p><figcaption>Generally available with Elastic 7.15, the Elastic App Search web crawler makes it easy to ingest website content</figcaption><p>To learn more visit the <a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elastic-enterprise-search-7-15-0\">Elastic Enterprise Search 7.15 blog</a>.\n</p><h2>Elastic Observability</h2><h3>Automate root cause analysis for faster application troubleshooting</h3><p>DevOps teams and site reliability engineers are constantly challenged by the need to sift through overwhelming amounts of data to keep modern applications performant and error-free. More often than not, this is a manual and time-consuming effort. To effectively resolve complex problems, these users need the ability to collect, unify, and analyze an increasing volume of telemetry data and quickly distill meaningful insights. Automation and machine intelligence have become essential components of the troubleshooter’s toolkit.\n</p><p>With Elastic 7.15, we’re excited to announce the general availability of Elastic Observability’s APM correlations feature. This new capability will help DevOps teams and site reliability engineers to accelerate root cause analysis by automatically surfacing attributes of the APM data set that are correlated with high-latency or erroneous transactions.<img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltebe967f6d2648245/613fa0d58540c92b07a99fdf/7-15-animation-apm-latency-correlations.gif\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltebe967f6d2648245\" alt=\"Elastic APM correlations, now generally available, accelerate root cause analysis to free up DevOps and SRE teams\">\n</p><figcaption>Elastic APM correlations, now generally available, accelerate root cause analysis to free up DevOps and SRE teams</figcaption><h3>Streamline monitoring of Google Cloud Platform services with frictionless log ingestion</h3><p>Elastic’s new Google Cloud Dataflow integration drives efficiency with the frictionless ingestion of log data directly from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

It provides a new layer of protection for Linux, Windows, and macOS hosts, powered by analytics that prevent attack techniques leveraged by known threats. This capability buttresses <a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-14-0\">existing malware and ransomware prevention</a> with dynamic prevention of post-execution behavior. Prevention is achieved by pairing post-execution analytics with response actions tailored to disrupt the adversary early in the attack, such as killing a process to stop a payload from being downloaded.\n</p><h3>Contain attacks with one-click host isolation from within Kibana</h3><p>In addition to malicious behavior protection, with the release of Elastic 7.15, Elastic Security enables analysts to quickly and easily quarantine Linux hosts via a remote action from Kibana. With (just) one click, analysts can respond to malicious activity by isolating a host from a network, containing the attack and preventing lateral movements. While <a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-14-0\">host isolation was introduced for Windows and macOS in version 7.14</a>, it is now available on every OS protected by Elastic Agent.\n</p><p>We’re implementing this capability on Linux systems via <a href=\"https://ebpf.io/\">extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF)</a> technology, a reflection of our commitment to technologies that enable users to observe and protect modern cloud-native systems in the most frictionless way possible.\n</p><p>For more information on our continuing efforts in the realm of cloud security, check out our recent announcements on Elastic joining forces with <a href=\"/blog/elastic-and-build-security-shifting-left-together-to-secure-the-cloud\">build.security</a> and <a href=\"/blog/elastic-and-cmd-join-forces-to-help-you-take-command-of-your-cloud-workloads\">Cmd</a>.\n</p><p>To learn more about what’s new with Elastic Security in 7.15, visit the <a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-15-0\">Elastic Security 7.15 blog</a>.\n</p><h2>Elastic Cloud</h2><p>Whether customers are looking to quickly find information, gain insights, or protect their technology investments (or all of the above), Elastic Cloud is the best way to experience the Elastic Search Platform. And we continue to improve that experience with new integrations that let customers ingest data into Elastic Cloud even more quickly and securely.\n</p><h3>Ingest data faster with Google Cloud Dataflow</h3><p>With Elastic 7.15, we’re pleased to announce the first-ever native Google Cloud data source integration to Elastic Cloud — Google Cloud Dataflow. This integration enables users to ship Pub/Sub, Big Query, and Cloud Storage&nbsp;data directly into their Elastic Cloud deployments without having to set up an extra intermediary data shipper, utilizing Google Cloud’s native serverless ETL service. The integration simplifies data architectures and helps users ingest data into Elastic Cloud faster.\n</p><h3>Ensure data privacy with the general availability of Google Cloud Private Service Connect</h3><p>We’re also excited to announce that support for Google Private Service Connect is now generally available. Google Private Service Connect provides private connectivity from Google Cloud virtual private clouds (VPCs) to Elastic Cloud deployments. The traffic between Google Cloud and Elastic Cloud deployments on Google Cloud travels only within the Google Cloud network, utilizing Private Service Connect endpoints and ensuring that customer data stays off the (public) internet.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blte6407921f8ae5b16/613fa6b2fbe3b82730060152/7-15-elastic-google-cloud-private-service-connect.jpg\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blte6407921f8ae5b16\" alt=\"Google Private Service Connect provides easy and private access to Elastic Cloud deployment endpoints while keeping all traffic within the Google network\"><br>\n</p><figcaption>Google Private Service Connect provides easy and private access to Elastic Cloud deployment endpoints while keeping all traffic within the Google network</figcaption><p>To learn more about what’s new with Elastic Cloud, visit the <a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elasticsearch-kibana-cloud-7-15-0\">Elastic Platform 7.15 blog</a>.\n</p><h2>Read more in our latest release blogs</h2><ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elastic-enterprise-search-7-15-0\">Elastic Enterprise Search 7.15 released</a></li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elastic-observability-7-15-0\">Elastic Observability 7.15 released</a></li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elastic-security-7-15-0\">Elastic Security 7.15 released</a></li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elasticsearch-kibana-cloud-7-15-0\">Elastic Platform 7.15 released</a></li>\n</ul><h2>Test our mettle</h2><p>Existing Elastic Cloud customers can access many of these features directly from the <a href=\"https://cloud.elastic.co/\">Elastic Cloud console</a>.

To further this mission, we’ve <a href=\"/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-searchable-snapshots\">lowered the costs</a> of storing and searching data, <a href=\"/blog/a-new-era-for-cluster-coordination-in-elasticsearch\">improved cluster resiliency</a> and <a href=\"/blog/elasticsearch-caching-deep-dive-boosting-query-speed-one-cache-at-a-time\">search performance</a>, <a href=\"/blog/elasticsearch-7-7-0-released\">lowered memory heap usage</a>, <a href=\"/blog/save-space-and-money-with-improved-storage-efficiency-in-elasticsearch-7-10\">improved storage efficiency</a>, and introduced <a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elasticsearch-7-14-0\">faster aggregations</a> in <a href=\"/blog/how-we-made-date-histogram-aggregations-faster-than-ever-in-elasticsearch-7-11\">multiple</a> Elasticsearch <a href=\"/blog/new-in-elasticsearch-7-13-even-faster-aggregations\">releases</a>. In this release, we not only improve data resiliency but also reduce data transfer traffic — a change designed specifically to lower our customers’ Elastic Cloud bills.&nbsp;\n</p><p>\n\t<img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/Uspe6FkqGYdYJqhiRC6EVv.jpg\" data-uuid=\"Uspe6FkqGYdYJqhiRC6EVv\" data-v=\"4\" data-type=\"inline\" data-autoplay=\"1\" data-loop=\"1\" data-disable_analytics=\"1\" data-hidden_controls=\"1\" data-muted=\"1\" disable_analytics=\"1\" alt=\"Improved data resiliency and reduced data transfer traffic with Elasticsearch\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\">\n</p><p>By <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/73497\">compressing specific inter-node traffic</a> and using snapshot storage to shortcut relocating <a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/73496\">shards between nodes</a>, we have reduced the amount of network traffic that traverses across the cluster, resulting in a reduction in Data Transfer and Storage (DTS) cost. This change will be most prominent for Elastic Cloud customers with heavy indexing or data migration between tiers.&nbsp;\n</p> <strong><h3>New APIs to help optimize and improve Elasticsearch performance</h3></strong><p>The best decisions are always data driven. Three new experimental APIs in 7.15 give you the tools to help analyze how you are using Elasticsearch usage and ultimately drive improved performance.&nbsp;\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/field-usage-stats.html\">field usage API</a> helps you decide how to index a <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/mapping-types.html\">field</a> based on usage statistics. For example, if a field is used frequently, it should be created with schema on write or at ingest time by using a <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/explicit-mapping.html\">mapping</a>. If the field is used infrequently, consider defining it at query time with <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/runtime.html\">runtime fields</a>. Changing a text field with an <code>inverted_index.term_frequencies</code> of zero and low <code>inverted_index.positions</code> to <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/text.html#match-only-text-field-type\"><code>match_only_text</code></a> (added in <a href=\"/blog/whats-new-elasticsearch-7-14-0\">7.14</a>) can <a href=\"/blog/save-10-percent-disk-space-on-your-logging-datasets-with-match-only-text\">save around 10% of disk</a>.\n</p><p>With the <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/indices-disk-usage.html\">index disk usage API</a> you can see how much disk space is consumed by every field in your index. Knowing what fields take up disk, you can decide which indexing option or field type is best. For example, <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/keyword.html\"><code>keyword</code></a> or <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/text.html#match-only-text-field-type\"><code>match_only_text </code></a> may be better than <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/text.html\"><code>text</code></a> for certain fields where scoring and positional information is not important. Or, use runtime fields to create a <code>keyword</code> at query time for flexibility and saving space.\n</p><p>Finally, the <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/search-vector-tile-api.html\">vector tiles API</a> provides a huge performance and scalability improvement when searching geo_points and geo_shapes drawn to a map (through use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_tiles\">vector tiles</a>). Offloading these calculations to the local GPU significantly improves performance while also lowering costs by reducing network traffic both within the cluster and to the client.&nbsp;\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt9e30423c748276df/614a8b52f725af79f53fd555/losangeles.gif\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"blt9e30423c748276df\" alt=\"losangeles.gif\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n</p> <strong><h3>Composite runtime fields</h3></strong><p>Elastic 7.15 continues to evolve the implementation of <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-runtime-fields?elektra=stack-and-cloud-7-15-blog\">runtime fields</a> in Elasticsearch and Kibana.&nbsp;\n</p><p>In Elasticsearch, composite runtime fields enable users to streamline field creation using one Painless script to emit multiple fields, with added efficiencies for field management. Use patterns like <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/runtime-examples.html#runtime-examples-grok\">grok</a> or <a href=\"/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.15/runtime-examples.html#runtime-examples-dissect\">dissect</a> to emit multiple fields using one script instead of creating and maintaining multiple scripts. Using existing grok patterns also makes it faster to create new runtime fields and reduces the time and complexity of creating and maintaining regex expressions. This development makes it easier and more intuitive for users to ingest new data like custom logs. See more on runtime fields in Kibana 7.15 below.\n</p> <strong><h2 id=\"kibana\">What’s new in Kibana 7.15</h2></strong> <strong><h3>Runtime fields editor preview pane</h3></strong><p>Combined with the introduction of composite fields for Elasticsearch (above), a new preview pane in the runtime fields editor in Kibana 7.15 makes it even easier to create fields on the fly. The preview pane empowers users to test and preview new fields before creating them — for example, by evaluating a new script against documents to check accuracy in Index Patterns, Discover, or Lens. In addition, pinning specific fields in the preview pane simplifies script creation. This enhancement also includes better error handling for the editor, all to help streamline the field creation process and allow users to create runtime fields more quickly. More developments for runtime fields are on the horizon as we continue to make previously ingested data easier to parse from Kibana.\n</p><div class=\"video embed-container\" style=\"height: 319.725px;\">\n\t<img class=\"vidyard-player-embed\" src=\"https://play.vidyard.com/2t7rLk7ZRn1QJhmVcYxsBp.jpg\" data-uuid=\"2t7rLk7ZRn1QJhmVcYxsBp\" data-v=\"4\" data-type=\"inline\" data-autoplay=\"1\" data-loop=\"1\" data-disable_analytics=\"1\" data-hidden_controls=\"1\" data-muted=\"1\" disable_analytics=\"1\" alt=\"Use the Kibana runtime fields editor preview pane to evaluate sample documents before creating a new field.\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: auto; display: block;\">\n</div><h2 id=\"stack-and-cloud-features\">Other updates across the Elastic Stack and Elastic Cloud</h2><h4>Elastic Cloud\n</h4><ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Leverage more cost-effective hardware options on GCP:</strong> Google Compute Engine’s (GCE) N2 VMs for Elastic Cloud deployments running on Google Cloud offer up to 20% better CPU performance compared to the previous generation N1 machine types.

We're now also able to&nbsp;show external dependencies, such as&nbsp;backends, caches, and databases, including how they are&nbsp;performing, their upstream dependencies, and how they have&nbsp;changed over time.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltf180dffa4d9ce8db/61423a4c564bf37c154f77c9/screenshot-apm-service-logs.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltf180dffa4d9ce8db\" alt=\"screenshot-apm-service-logs.png\" \"=\"\">\n</p><figcaption>Get an integrated roll-up view of application logs across application services running on ephemeral infrastructure to quickly find errors and other causes of application issues.</figcaption><p><em><br></em>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltec7d31bd64c02a0d/61423a679d27cf7da4ba02a9/screenshot-dependencies-redis.png\" data-sys-asset-uid=\"bltec7d31bd64c02a0d\" alt=\"screenshot-dependencies-redis.png\"><br>\n</p><figcaption>Identify issues with third-party and backend service dependencies, and leverage detailed drilldowns for comparing historical performance and impact on&nbsp;upstream services.</figcaption><p><span style=\"background-color: initial;\"></span><span style=\"background-color: initial;\">We’ve also enhanced the existing transaction latency distribution chart and trace selection with more granular buckets and the flexibility to drag-select all application traces that fall within a desired range of latencies.</span>\n</p><h2>Agentless ingestion of logs from Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for frictionless observability&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</h2><p>Elastic’s new GCP Dataflow integration drives efficiency with frictionless ingestion of log data directly from the Google Cloud console.

Previously,&nbsp;Osquery could&nbsp;be used via Kibana to perform live and scheduled queries, with the query results stored in a dedicated data stream. With 7.15, Osquery is now directly integrated into the enhanced host details panel and delivers&nbsp;ad hoc querying capabilities on the target host.\n</p><h2>Self-managed version of Elastic Package Registry (EPR) now available for air-gapped deployments</h2><p>If you host your Elastic Stack in an air-gapped environment and want to take advantage of the recently GA <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-agent-and-fleet-make-it-easier-to-integrate-your-systems-with-elastic\" target=\"_blank\">Elastic Agent and Fleet</a>, we have good news for you.
